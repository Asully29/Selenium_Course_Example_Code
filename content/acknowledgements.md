A huge thanks to [Unmesh Gundecha](https://twitter.com/upgundecha) and [Peter Bittner](https://github.com/bittner)!

Unmesh's work was a big help and an inspiration when it finally came time for me to write a Python edition of my book. His book titled "[Learning Selenium Testing Tools with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Selenium-Testing-Tools-Python/dp/1783983507/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=)" is a great resource and I highly recommend it if you are looking to use `unittest` in your Selenium practice.

Peter provided a tremendous amount of feedback to me about the code examples in this book. He recommended ways I could strive to make many of the examples more Python-like, readable, and resilient. Thank you Peter! The book is better because of your input.
