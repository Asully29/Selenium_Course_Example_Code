# Acknowledgements

Writing this book in Java was always something I thought about doing. But it wasn't until some thoughtful encouragement from Ravi Gupta that I finally made up my mind to do it. Thanks Ravi, I hope this was what you were looking for.

Also a huge thanks to Jonathan Taylor, Matthew Edwards, Josh Grant, and Brian Goad for offering to review my code, providing constructive feedback, and acting as a general sounding board. No matter the amount of effort you put forth (big or small) this book better as a result of your help. Thank you!

And lastly I'd like to thank you, the reader. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have started writing about Selenium years ago -- let alone consider porting my book into other programming languages. Thanks for reading! I hope you find it useful in your daily work.


Cheers,
Dave H
