# Preface

This book is a compendium of tips from my weekly Selenium tip newsletter ([Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com/)). It's aim is to give you a glimpse into the things you'll see in the wild, and a reference for how to deal with them.

These tips were originally only available in Ruby, and I've been steadily converting them over to Java thanks to the contributions I've received since open-sourcing my example code (which you can see [here](https://github.com/tourdedave/elemental-selenium-tips)). I'd especially like to thank [Roman Isko](https://github.com/RomanIsko) for his contributions. He submitted code examples for 17 tips which have all been accepted and used with few modifications. Thank you!

The tips differ from The Selenium Guidebook in that they do not build upon previous examples. Instead, they serve as standalone works that can be consumed individually. So feel free to read them in order, or jump around.

Enjoy!
