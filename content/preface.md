# Preface

This book is a compendium of tips from my weekly Selenium tip newsletter ([Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com/)). Its aim is to give you a glimpse into the things you'll see in the wild, and a reference for how to deal with them.

These tips were originally only available in Ruby and I've been steadily converting them over to the officially supported programming languages offered by Selenium. I'm excited to finally add Python to the collection. The initial push was thanks to the contributions I've received since open-sourcing my example code (which you can see [here](https://github.com/tourdedave/elemental-selenium-tips)).

A big thanks to [Mike Millgate](https://github.com/trabulmonkee), [Isaul Vargas](https://github.com/Dude-X), and [Peter Bittner](https://github.com/bittner) for their contributions! Mike provided code for five of the tips in this compendium, with help from Isaul & Peter who provided code reviews. Thank you!

The tips differ from The Selenium Guidebook in that they do not build upon previous examples. Instead, they serve as standalone works that can be consumed individually. So feel free to read them in order or jump around.

Enjoy!
