# Locators

## Guiding principles

Good Locators are:

+ unique
+ descriptive
+ unlikely to change

Be sure to:

1. Start with ID and Class
2. Use CSS selectors (or XPath) when you need to traverse
3. Talk with a developer on your team when the app is hard to automate
  + tell them what you're trying to automate
  + work with them to get more semantic markup added to the page

### ID 

```java
driver.findElement(By.id("username"));
```


### Class

```java
driver.findElement(By.className("dues"));
```


### CSS Selectors

```java
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#username"));
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".dues"));
```

| Approach          | Locator                                  | Description                                   |
| -----------------:| :-------------                           | :--------------                               |
| ID                | `#example`                               | `#` denotes an ID                             |
| Class             | `.example`                               | `.` denotes a Class                           |
| Classes           | `.flash.success`                         | use `.` in front of each class for multiple   |
| Direct child      | `div > a`                                | finds the element in the next child           |
| Child/subschild   | `div a`                                  | finds the element in a child or child's child |
| Next sibling      | `input.username + input`                 | finds the next adjacent element               |
| Attribute values  | `form input[name='username']`            | a great alternative to id and class matches   |
| Attribute values  | `input[name='continue'][type='button']`  | can chain multiple attribute filters together |
| Location          | `li:nth-child(4)`                        | finds the 4th element only if it is an li     |
| Location          | `li:nth-of-type(4)`                      | finds the 4th li in a list                    |
| Location          | `*:nth-child(4)`                         | finds the 4th element regardless of type      |
| Sub-string        | `a[id^='beginning_']`                    | finds a match that starts with (prefix)       |
| Sub-string        | `a[id$='_end']`                          | finds a match that ends with (suffix)         |
| Sub-string        | `a[id*='gooey_center']`                  | finds a match that contains (substring)       |
| Inner text        | `a:contains('Log Out')`                  | an alternative to substring matching          |

__NOTE: Older browser (e.g., Internet Explorer 8) don't support CSS Pseudo-classes, so some of these locator approaches won't work on them (e.g., Location matches and Inner text matches).__
