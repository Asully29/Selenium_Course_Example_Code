# Locators

## Guiding principles

Good Locators are:

+ unique
+ descriptive
+ unlikely to change

Be sure to:

1. Start with IDs and Classes
2. Use CSS selectors or XPath when you need to traverse
3. Talk with a developer on your team when the app is hard to automate
  + tell them what you're trying to automate
  + work with them to get more semantic markup added to the page

## CSS

### ID
### Class
### Direct Child
### Child (or subchild)
### Next sibling
### Attribute values
### Dynamic matches
### Sub-string matches
### Inner text matches
