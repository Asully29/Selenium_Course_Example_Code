# A Programming Primer

This section will prime you with just enough programming concepts (and how they pertain to testing) to get you going so that you have some working knowledge and a vocabulary that will enable you to more effectively comprehend what you will see throughout this book and in your work afterwards.

Don't get too hung up on the details yet. If something doesn't make sense, it should once we dig into the full examples in the following chapters. Consider this more of a glossary than a code school.

Programming can be a deep and intimidating rabbit hole if you're new to it. But don't worry. When it comes to testing there is only a small subset of Ruby that we really need to work with to get started. Granted, the more you know, the better off you'll be. But you don't need to know a whole lot to be an effective test automator right now.

Of all the programming concepts out there, here are the ones you'll need to pay attention to first:

+ Object Structures (Variables, Methods, and Classes)
+ Scope (pubic, protected, private)
+ Object Types (Strings, Integers, Booleans, etc.)
+ Actions (Assertions and Conditionals)
+ Annotations
+ Inheritance

Let's step through each and how they pertain to testing with Selenium.

### Object Structures

#### Variables

Variables are objects where you can store and retrieve values of the type you specify (e.g., String, Boolean, etc.). They are created and referenced by a name that:

+ is case-sensitive
+ must not be a keyword or reserved word
+ starts with a letter
+ if its one word, is all lowercase
+ if its more than one word, is [camelcase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) (e.g., `exampleVariable`)

You can store a value in a variable by using an equals sign (e.g., `=`). But you'll only be able to store a value of the type specified when creating the variable.

```java
String exampleVariable1 = "string value";
System.out.println(exampleVariable1.getClass());
// outputs: class java.lang.String

Integer exampleVariable2 = 42;
System.out.println(exampleVariable2.getClass());
// outputs: class java.lang.Integer
```

In the code snippet above we're using `System.out.println();` to output a message. This is a common command that is useful for generating output to the terminal.

In Selenium, a common example of a variable is storing an element (or a value from an element) in the beginning of a test to be referenced later. For example, getting a page's title.

```java
String pageTitle = driver.getTitle();
```

`driver` is the variable we will use to interact with Selenium throughout the book. More on that later.

#### Methods

One way to group common actions and behavior together for easy reuse is to place them into methods. We define a method within a class (more on those next) by specifying a modifier, a return type, and a name.

We'll cover modifiers in `Scope`, for now you can just set it to `public`. A return type is used to specify what type of an object you want to return when the method is run. If you don't want to return anything, specify the return type as `void`.

Method naming follows similar conventions to variables. The main difference being that they tend to start with a verb (since they denote some kind of an action to be performed). Also, the contents of the method are wrapped in opening and closing brackets (e.g., `{}`).

```java
public void sayHello() {
  // your code goes here
}
```

Additionally, you can make a method accept an argument when calling it. This is done with a parameter.

```java
public void sayHello(String message) {
  System.out.println(message);
}
```

We'll see methods put to use in numerous places in our test code. First and foremost in the tests themselves when setting up and tearing down instances of Selenium.

```java
public void setUp() {
    driver = new FirefoxDriver();
}

public void tearDown() {
    driver.quit();
}
```

#### Classes

Classes are a useful way to store the state and behavior of something complex for reuse.

hey can contain variables and methods, and are defined with the word class followed by the name you wish to give it. Class names:

+ must start with a capital letter
+ should be CamelCase for multiple words (e.g., class ExampleClass)
+ should be descriptive

You first have to define a class, and then create an instance of it (a.k.a. instantiation) in order to use it. Once you have this instance, you can access the methods within it to trigger an action.

The most common example of this in Selenium is when creating a class to represent a web page (a.k.a. a page object). In the class you store the elements on the page, and the behavior you can do on the page.

```java
// code in page object
public class Login {

    private WebDriver driver;
    By usernameLocator  = By.id("username");
    By passwordLocator  = By.id("password");
    By loginFormLocator = By.id("login");

    public void with(String username, String password) {
...
// code in test
Login login = new Login
login.with("username", "password"):
```
