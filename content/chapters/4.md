# A Programming Primer

This section will prime you with just enough programming concepts (and how they pertain to testing) to get you going so that you have some working knowledge and a vocabulary that will enable you to more effectively comprehend what you will see throughout the remainder of this book and in your work after you put this book down.

Don't get too hung up on the details yet. If something doesn't make sense, it should once we dig into the full examples in the following chapters. Consider this more of a glossary than a code school.
