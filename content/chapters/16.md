# Automating Your Test Runs

You'll probably get a lot of mileage out of your test suite in its current form if you just run things from your computer, look at the results, and tell people when there are issues. But that only helps you solve part of the problem.

The real goal in test automation is to find issues reliably, quickly, and automatically. We've built things to be reliable and quick. Now we need to make them run on there own, and ideally, in sync with the development workflow you are a part of.

To do that we need to use a Continuous Integration server.

## A Continuous Integration Server Primer

A Continous Integration server (a.k.a. CI) is responsible for merging code that is actively being developed into a central place (e.g., “trunk” or “master”) frequently (e.g., several times a day, or on every code commit) to find issues early so they can be addressed quickly — all for the sake of releasing working software in a timely fashion.

With CI, we can automate our test runs so they can happen as part of the development workflow. The lion’s share of tests that are typically run on a CI Server are unit (and potentially integration) tests. But we can very easily add in our automated mobile tests.

There are numerous CI Servers available for use today, most notably:

+ [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)
+ [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)
+ [Solano Labs](https://www.solanolabs.com/)
+ [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)

Let's pick one and step through an example.

## A CI Example

[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) is a fully functional, widely adopted, and open-source CI server. It’s a great candidate for us to step through.

Lets start by setting it up on the same machine as our test code. Keep in mind that this isn’t the "proper" way to go about this — its merely beneficial for this example. To do it right, the Jenkins server (e.g., master node) would live on a machine of its own.

### Part 1: Quick Setup

A simple way to get started is to grab the latest Jenkins war file. You can grab it from the [Jenkins homepage](http://jenkins-ci.org/), or from [its direct download link](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/latest/jenkins.war).

Once downloaded, launch it from your terminal.

```
> java -jar jenkins.war
...
hudson.WebAppMain$3 run
INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running
```

You will now be able to use Jenkins by visiting http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

![Jenkins Home Screen](img/screenshots/jenkins_home.png)

__NOTE: Before moving to the next step, click `ENABLE AUTO-REFRESH` at the top right-hand side of the page. Otherwise you'll need to manually refresh the page when it updates (e.g., when running a job and waiting for results to appear).__

### Part 2: Job Creation And Configuration

Now that Jenkins is loaded in the browser, let's create a Job and configure it to run our Shallow tests against an old version of Internet Explorer (e.g., IE8).

+ Click `New Item` from the top-left of the Dashboard
+ Give it a name (e.g., `Shallow Tests IE8`)
+ Select the `Maven project` option
+ Click `OK`

![Jenkins New Job](img/screenshots/jenkins_new_job.png)

This will load a configuration screen for the Jenkins job.

![Jenkins Job Configuration[(img/screenshots/jenkins_job_config.png)

+ Scroll down until you reach the `Build` section (near the bottom of the page)
+ Specify the absolute path to your `pom.xml` in `Room POM`
+ Specify the run commands you want to use in `Goals and options` (e.g., `clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser="internet explorer" -DbrowserVersion=8`)

![Jenkins Build](img/screenshots/jenkins_job_build.png)

__NOTE: Ideally, your test code would live in a version control system and you would configure your job (under `Source Code Management`) to pull it in and run it. To use this approach you may need to install a plugin to handle it. For more info on plugins in Jenkins, go [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins).__

Now we're ready to save, run our tests, and view the job result.

+ Click `Save`
+ Click `Build Now` from the left-hand side of the screen

When the build completes, the result will be listed on the job's home screen. In this case, the job passed.

![Jenkins Job Result From First Run](img/screenshots/jenkins_job_run_passed.png)

__NOTE: If you had a different result, you can drill into a job to see what was happening behind the scenes. To do that click on the build you want from `Build History` and select `Console Output`. This output will be your best bet in tracking down an unexpected result.__

A passing job means passing tests, which is great. But we'll also want to see what a failure looks like to make sure its helpful.

### Part 3: Force A Failure

Let's add a new test method to `TestLogin.java` that will fail every time we run it.

```java
// filename: tests/TestLogin.java
...
    @Test
    @Category(Shallow.class)
    public void forcedFailure() {
        pageobjects.Login login = new pageobjects.Login(driver);
        login.with("tomsmithasdf", "SuperSecretPassword!");

        assertTrue("success message wasn't present after logging in",
                login.successMessagePresent());
    }

}
```

This test mimics our `failure` test by visiting the login page and providing invalid credentials. The difference is in the assertion. It will fail since a success message won't be present after attempting to login with bogus credentials.

Now when we run our Jenkins job again, it will fail.

![Jenkins Job Screen With Failure](img/screenshots/jenkins_job_run_failed.png)

When we click on `Latest Test Result` we can see the test that failed (e.g., `tests.TestLogin.forcedFailure`).

![Jenkins Job Test Result](img/screenshots/jenkins_job_run_failed_test_result.png)

And if we click on the failed test, we can see the failure message along with a URL to the job in Sauce Labs.

![Jenkins Job Test Result Individual](img/screenshots/jenkins_job_run_failed_test_result_detail.png)

When we follow the URL to the Sauce Labs job we're able to see what happened during the test run (e.g., we can replay a video of the test, see what Selenium commands were issued, etc.).

## Notifications

In order to maximize your CI effectiveness, you'll want to send out notifications to alert your team members when there's a failure.

There are numerous ways to go about this (e.g., e-mail, chat, text, co-located visual cues, etc). And thankfully there are numerous, freely available plugins that can help facilitatee whichever method you want. You can find out more about Jenkins' plugins [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins).__

For instance, if you want to use chat notifications and you use a service like HipChat or Slack, you would do a plugin search and turn up the following plugins:

![Jenkins Plugin HipChat](img/screenshots/jenkins_plugin_hipchat.png)
![Jenkins Plugin Slack](img/screenshots/jenkins_plugin_slack.png)

After installing the plugin you will need to provide the necessary information to configure it (e.g., an authorization token, the channel/chat room where you want notifications to go, what kinds of notifications you want sent, etc.) and then add it as a `Post-build Action` to your job (or jobs).

After installing and configuring a plugin, when your CI job runs and fails, a notification will be sent to the chat room you configured.

## Ideal Workflow

In the last chapter we covered test grouping with categories and applied some preliminary ones to our tests (e.g., "Shallow" and "Deep"). These categories are perfect for setting up an initial test automation workflow.

To start the workflow we'll want to identify a triggering event. Something like a CI job for unit or integration tests that the developers on your team use. Whenever that runs and passes, we can trigger our "Shallow" test job to run (e.g., our smoke or sanity tests). If the job passes then we can trigger a job for "Deep" tests to run. Assuming that passes, we can consider the code ready to be promoted to the next phase of release (e.g., manual testing, push to a staging, etc.) and send out a relevant notification.

__NOTE: You may need to incorporate automatic code deployment as a preliminary action before your "Shallow" and "Deep" jobs can be run. Consult a developer on your team for help if that's the case.__

## Outro

By using a CI Server you're able to put your tests to work by using computers for what they're good at -- automation. This frees you up to focus on more important things. Keep in mind that there are numerous ways to configure your CI server. Be sure to tune it to what works best for you and your team. It's well worth the effort.
