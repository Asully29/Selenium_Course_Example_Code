# Verifying Your Locators

If you're fortunate enough to be working with unique IDs and Classes, then you're usually all set. But when you have to handle more complex actions like traversing a page, or you need to run down odd test behavior, it can be a real challenge to verify that you have the right locators to accomplish what you want.

Instead of the painful and tedious process of trying out various locators in your tests until you get what you're looking for, try verifying them in the browser instead.

## A Solution

Built into every major browser is the ability to verify locators from the JavaScript Console.

Simply open the developer tools in your browser and navigate to the JavaScript Console (e.g., right-click on an element, select `Inspect Element`, and click into the `Console` tab). From here it's a simple matter of specifying the locator you want to look up by the `$$('')` command (e.g., `$$('#username')`) and hovering your mouse over what is returned in the console. The element that was found will be highlighted in the viewport pane.

## An Example

Let's try to identify the locators necessary to traverse a few levels into a large set of nested divs.

```html
# a snippet from http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/large

<div id='siblings'>
  <div id='sibling-1.1'>1.1
  <div id='sibling-1.2'>1.2</div>
  <div id='sibling-1.3'>1.3</div>
    <div id='sibling-2.1'>2.1
    <div id='sibling-2.2'>2.2</div>
    <div id='sibling-2.2'>2.3</div>
      <div id='sibling-3.1'>3.1
      <div id='sibling-3.2'>3.2</div>
      <div id='sibling-3.2'>3.3</div>
        <div id='sibling-3.1'>4.1
        <div id='sibling-3.2'>4.2</div>
        <div id='sibling-3.2'>4.3</div>
        <!-- ... -->
```

If we perform a `FindElement` action using the following locator, it works.

```javascript
driver.findElement({css: 'div#siblings > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(1)'});
```

But if we try to go one level deeper with the same strategy, it won't work.

```javascript
driver.findElement({css: 'div#siblings > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(1)'});
```

Fortunately with our in-browser approach to verifying our locators, we can quickly discern where the issue is. Here's what it shows us for the locators that "worked".

It looks like our locators are scoping to the wrong part of the first level (1.2). But we need to reference the third part of each level (e.g., 1.3, 2.3, 3.3) in order to traverse deeper since the nested divs live under the third part of each level.

So if we try this locator instead, it should work.

```javascript
driver.findElement({css: 'div#siblings > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(3) > div:nth-of-type(3)'});
```

And we can confirm that it works before changing any test code by looking in the JavaScript Console.

This should help save you time and frustration when running down tricky locators in your tests. It definitely has for me.
