# Writing Really Re-usable Test Code

In the previous chapter we stepped through creating a simple page object to capture the behavior of the page we were interacting with. While this was a good start, it leaves some room for improvement.

As our test suite grows and we add more page objects we will start to see common behavior that we will want to use over and over again throughout our suite. If we leave this unchecked we will end up with duplicative code which will slowly make our page objects harder to maintain. 

Right now we are using Selenium actions directly in our page object. While on the face of it this may seem fine, it has some long term impacts, like:

+ slower page object creation due to the lack of a simple Domain Specific Language (DSL)
+ test maintenance issues when the Selenium API changes (e.g., major changes between Selenium RC and Selenium WebDriver)
+ the inability to swap out the driver for your tests (e.g., mobile, REST, etc.)

With a Base Page Object (a.k.a. a facade layer) we can easily side step these concerns by abstracting all of our common actions into a central class and leveraging it in our page objects.

## An Example

Let's step through an example with our login page object.

### Part 1: Create The Base Page Object

First let's create the base page object by adding a file called `BasePage.cs` to the `pageobjects` package.

```text
├── PageObjects
│   ├── BasePage.cs
│   └── LoginPage.cs
├── Tests
│   └── LoginTest.cs
├── Vendor
│   └── geckodriver.exe
└── packages.config
```

Next let's populate the file.

```csharp
// filename: PageObjects/BasePage.cs
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI;

namespace PageObjects
{
    class BasePage
    {
        IWebDriver Driver;

        protected BasePage(IWebDriver driver)
        {
            this.Driver = driver;
        }

        protected void Visit(string url)
        {
            Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(url);
        }

        protected IWebElement Find(By locator)
        {
            return Driver.FindElement(locator);
        }

        protected void Click(By locator)
        {
            Find(locator).Click();
        }

        protected void Type(By locator, string inputText)
        {
            Find(locator).SendKeys(inputText);
        }

        protected bool IsDisplayed(By locator)
        {
            return Find(locator).Displayed;
        }
    }
}
```

After declaring the class (e.g., `class BasePage`) we receive and store an instance of Selenium just like in our Login page object. But what's different here is the methods that come after the constructor (e.g., `Visit`, `Find`, `Click`, `Type`, and `IsDisplayed`). Each one stores a specific behavior we've used in our tests. Some of the names are the same as you've seen in Selenium, others renamed (for improved readability).

Now that we have all of our Selenium actions in one place, let's update our login page object to leverage this facade.

```csharp
// filename: PageObjects/LoginPage.cs
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace PageObjects
{
    class LoginPage : BasePage
    {
        By LoginForm = By.Id("login");
        By UsernameInput = By.Id("username");
        By PasswordInput = By.Id("password");
        By SubmitButton = By.CssSelector("button");
        By SuccessMessage = By.CssSelector(".flash.success");
        By FailureMessage = By.CssSelector(".flash.error");

        public LoginPage(IWebDriver driver) : base(driver)
        {
            Visit("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login");
            Assert.That(IsDisplayed(LoginForm));
        }

        public void With(string username, string password)
        {
            Type(UsernameInput, username);
            Type(PasswordInput, password);
            Click(SubmitButton);
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }

        public bool SuccessMessagePresent()
        {
            return IsDisplayed(SuccessMessage);
        }

        public bool FailureMessagePresent()
        {
            return IsDisplayed(FailureMessage);
        }
    }
}
```

Two fundamental things have changed in our Login page object.

First, we've established inheritance between `BasePage` and `LoginPage` with `class LoginPage : BasePage`. This means that `LoginPage` is now a child of `BasePage`. In order to make the methods in the parent class work, we call the constructor in the parent class and pass the `driver` object to it (e.g., `public LoginPage(IWebDriver driver) : base(driver)`.

Second, we've swapped out all of the Selenium actions to use the methods made available from `BasePage` thanks to inheritance.

If we save everything and run our tests they will run and pass just like before. But now, our page objects are more readable, simpler to write, and easier to maintain and extend.

### Part 2: Add Some Error Handling

Remember in the previous chapter when we ran into an error with Selenium when we looked for an element that wasn't on the page? Let's address that now.

To recap -- here's the error message we saw:

```sh
Result StackTrace:
Result Message: OpenQA.Selenium.NoSuchElementException : Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":".flash.success"}
```

The important thing to note is the exception Selenium offered up -- the part that comes before `Unable to locate element` (e.g., `OpenQA.Selenium.NoSuchElementException`). Let's modify the `IsDisplayed` method in our base page object to handle it.

```csharp
// filename: PageObjects/BasePage.cs
// ...
        protected bool IsDisplayed(By locator)
        {
            try {
                return Find(locator).Displayed;
            } catch(OpenQA.Selenium.NoSuchElementException) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By wrapping our Selenium action (e.g., `return Find(locator).isDisplayed();`) in a `try`/`catch` we're able to catch the exception and return `false` instead. This will enable us to see if an element is on the page. If it's not, we'll receive a `false` Boolean rather than an exception.

With this new handling in place, let's revisit our `BadPasswordProvided()` login test and alter it so it checks to see if the success message is not present (which would normally trigger a `NoSuchElementException`) to make sure things work as we expect.

```csharp
// filename: Tests/LoginTest.cs
// ...
        [Test]
        public void BadPasswordProvided()
        {
            Login.With("tomsmith", "bad password");
            Assert.That(Login.SuccessMessagePresent, Is.Not.True);
        }
    }
}
```

When we save our changes and run this test it will run and pass without throwing an exception.
