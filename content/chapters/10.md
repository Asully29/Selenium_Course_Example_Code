# Writing Resilient Test Code

Ideally you should be able to write your tests once and run them across all supported browsers. While this is a rosy proposition, there is some work to make this a reliable success. And sometimes there may be a hack or two involved. But the lengths you must go really depends on the browsers you care about and the functionality you're dealing with in your application.

By using high quality locators we're already in good shape, but there are still some issues to deal with. Most notably... timing. This is especially true when working with dynamic, JavaScript heavy pages (which is more the rule than the exception in a majority of web applications you'll deal with).

But there is a simple approach that makes up the bedrock of reliable and resilient Selenium tests -- and that's how you wait and interact with elements. The best way to accomplish this is through the use of __explicit waits__.

## An Explicit Waits Primer

Explicit waits are applied to individual test actions. Each time you want to use one you specify an amount of time (in seconds) and the Selenium action you want to accomplish.

Selenium will repeatedly try this action until either it can be accomplished, or until the amount of time specified has been reached. If the latter occurs, a timeout exception will be thrown.

## An Example

Let's step through an example that demonstrates this against [a dynamic page on the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1). The functionality is pretty simple -- there is a button. When you click it a loading bar appears for 5 seconds. After that it disappears and is replaced with the text `Hello World!`.

### Part 1: Create A New Page Object And Update The Base Page Object

Here's the markup from the page.

```html
<div class="example">
  <h3>Dynamically Loaded Page Elements</h3>
  <h4>Example 1: Element on page that is hidden</h4>

  <br>

  <div id="start">
    <button>Start</button>
  </div>

  <div id="finish" style="display:none">
    <h4>Hello World!</h4>
  </div>

</div>
```

At a glance it's simple enough to tell that there are unique `id` attributes that we can use to find and click on the start button and verify the finish text.

When writing automation for new functionality like this, you may find it easier to write the test first (to get it working how you'd like) and then create a page object for it (pulling out the behavior and locators from your test). There's no right or wrong answer here. Do what feels intuitive to you. But for this example, we'll create the page object first, and then write the test.

Let's create a new page object file called `DynamicLoadingPage.js` in the `pages` directory.

```text
├── package.json
├── pages
│   ├── BasePage.js
│   ├── DynamicLoadingPage.js
│   └── LoginPage.js
└── test
    └── LoginTest.js
```

In this file we'll establish inheritance to the base page object and specify the locators and behavior we'll want to use.

```javascript
// filename: pages/DynamicLoadingPage.js
'use strict';
var BasePage = require('./BasePage');

var START_BUTTON = {css: '#start button'};
var FINISH_TEXT = {id: 'finish'};

function DynamicLoadingPage(driver) {
  BasePage.call(this, driver);
}

DynamicLoadingPage.prototype = Object.create(BasePage.prototype);
DynamicLoadingPage.prototype.constructor = DynamicLoadingPage;

DynamicLoadingPage.prototype.loadExample = function(exampleNumber) {
  this.visit('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/' + exampleNumber);
  this.click(START_BUTTON);
};

DynamicLoadingPage.prototype.finishTextPresent = function() {
  return this.waitForIsDisplayed(FINISH_TEXT, 10000);
};

module.exports = DynamicLoadingPage;
```

Since there are two dynamic loading examples to choose from on the-internet we created the method `loadExample`. It accepts a number as an argument so we can specify which of the examples we want to visit and start.

And similar to our Login page object, we have a display check for the finish text (e.g., `finishTextPresent`). This check is slightly different though. Aside from the different name we're using (e.g., `waitForIsDisplayed`), it has a second argument (an integer value of `10000`). This is a bit of aspirational code that we'll need to write. And this millisecond argument is how we'll specify how long we'd like Selenium to wait for an element to be displayed before giving up.

Let's update our base page object to add this new `waitForIsDisplayed` method which will enable explicit waits.

```javascript
// filename: pages/BasePage.js
'use strict';

var driver,
    Promise = require('selenium-webdriver').promise,
    Until = require('selenium-webdriver').until;
// ...
BasePage.prototype.waitForIsDisplayed = function(locator, timeout) {
  var defer = Promise.defer();
  var driver = this.driver;
  driver.wait(Until.elementLocated(locator), timeout).then(function() {
    var element = driver.findElement(locator);
    driver.wait(Until.elementIsVisible(element), timeout).then(function() {
      defer.fulfill(true);
    }, function(error) {
      if (error.name === 'NoSuchElementError') {
        defer.fulfill(false);
      } else {
        defer.reject(error);
      }
    });
  });
  return defer.promise;
};
```

Selenium comes with a wait function which we require and store in a method (e.g., `Until = require('selenium-webdriver').until;`).

The `waitForIsDisplayed` method takes a locator and a timeout. Inside the method we take advantage of `Promise.defer();` again. And we also store the Selenium instance in a local variable (more on that soon). Next we call `driver.wait` and provide an initial condition that we want to wait for (e.g., wait until the element is located) and pass in the locator and timeout (e.g., `(Until.elementLocated(locator), timeout)`). We then trigger a promise (e.g., `.then(function() {`). In this new function we start to lose scope of the class that we're in. As a result we're not able to access other class methods (like `this.find`), but we can access local variables in the method (like the local `driver` instance we created at the top of the method).

__NOTE: This initial tap-dance is necessary since the display lookup we want to do requires the use of a found element, which is tricky since we have to account for the `NoSuchElementError` exception later on in the error callback.__

In this new promise we do an element lookup which gets passed into another wait condition (e.g., wait until the element is visible -- which is the same thing as `.isDisplayed()` but through the explicit wait API). We then initiate a new promise, this time to handle the promise outcome. If things go as planned we fulfill the promise with `true` (e.g., `defer.fulfill(true);`). If there's a `NoSuchElementError` we fulfill `false`. For all other errors we reject the promise and return the error (e.g., `defer.reject(error);`). And at the end of the method we return the promise.

There are other conditions you can wait for besides `elementLocated` or `elementIsVisible`. You can find a list [here in the API documentation](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/until.html).

## More On Explicit Waits

It's important to set a _reasonably sized_ timeout for the explicit wait method. But you want to be careful not to make it too high. Otherwise you can run into timing issues. But set it too low and your tests will be brittle, forcing you to run down trivial and transient issues.

The major benefit of explicit waits is that if the behavior on the page takes longer than we expect (e.g., due to slow load times, or a feature change), we can simply adjust this one wait time to fix the test -- rather than increase a blanket wait time (which impacts every test). And since the wait is dynamic (e.g., constantly polling), it won't take the full amount of time to complete (like a hard-coded sleep would).

If you're thinking about mixing explicit waits with an implicit wait -- DON'T. If you use both together you're going to run into issues later on due to inconsistent implementations of the implicit wait functionality across local and remote browser drivers. Long story short, you'll end up with tests that could fail randomly and when they do they will be hard to debug. You can read more about the specifics [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15164742/combining-implicit-wait-and-explicit-wait-together-results-in-unexpected-wait-ti#answer-15174978).

### Part 2: Write A Test To Use The New Page Object

Now that we have our new page object and an updated base page, it's time to write our test to use it.

Let's create a new file called `DynamicLoadingTest.js` in the `test` directory.

```text
├── package.json
├── pages
│   ├── BasePage.js
│   ├── DynamicLoadingPage.js
│   └── LoginPage.js
└── test
    ├── DynamicLoadingTest.js
    └── LoginTest.js
```

The contents of this test file are similar to `LoginTest.js` with regards to its setup and structure.

```javascript
// filename: test/DynamicLoadingTest.js
'use strict';
var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
var test = require('selenium-webdriver/testing');
var assert = require('assert');
var DynamicLoadingPage = require('../pages/DynamicLoadingPage');

test.describe('Dynamic Loading', function() {
  this.timeout(30000);
  var driver;
  var dynamicLoading;

  test.beforeEach(function() {
    driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('firefox').build();
    dynamicLoading = new DynamicLoadingPage(driver);
  });

  test.afterEach(function() {
    driver.quit();
  });

  test.it('hidden element', function() {
    dynamicLoading.loadExample('1');
    dynamicLoading.finishTextPresent().then(function(elementDisplayed) {
      assert.equal(elementDisplayed, true, 'Finish text not displayed');
    });
  });
});
```

In our test (e.g., `'hidden element'`) we are visiting the first dynamic loading example and clicking the start button (which is accomplished in `dynamicLoading.loadExample('1');`). We're then asserting that the finish text gets displayed.

When we save this and run it (e.g., `mocha test/DynamicLoadingTest.js` from the command-line) it will:

+ Launch a browser
+ Visit the page
+ Click the start button
+ Wait for the loading bar to complete
+ Find the finish text
+ Assert that it is displayed.
+ Close the browser

### Part 3: Update Page Object And Add A New Test

Let's step through one more example to see if our explicit wait holds up.

[The second dynamic loading example](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2) is laid out similarly to the last one. The only difference is that it renders the final text __after__ the progress bar completes (whereas the previous example had the element on the page but it was hidden).

Here's the markup for it.

```html
<div class="example">
  <h3>Dynamically Loaded Page Elements</h3>
  <h4>Example 2: Element rendered after the fact</h4>

  <br>

  <div id="start">
    <button>Start</button>
  </div>

  <br>
</div>
```

In order to find the selector for the finish text element we need to inspect the page _after_ the loading bar sequence finishes. Here's what it looks like.

```html
<div id="finish" style=""><h4>Hello World!</h4></div>
```

Let's add a second test to `DynamicLoadingTest.js` called `'rendered element'` that will load this second example and perform the same check as we did for the previous test.

```javascript
// filename: test/DynamicLoadingTest.js
  test.it('rendered element', function() {
    dynamicLoading.loadExample('2');
    dynamicLoading.finishTextPresent().then(function(elementDisplayed) {
      assert.equal(elementDisplayed, true, 'Finish text not displayed');
    });
  });
```

When we run both tests (e.g., `mocha test/DynamicLoadingTest.js` from the command-line) we will see that the same approach will work in both cases of how the page is constructed.

## Browser Timing

Using explicit waits gets you pretty far. But there are a few things you'll want to think about when it comes to writing your tests to work on various browsers.

It's simple enough to write your tests locally against Firefox and assume you're all set. But once you start to run things against other browsers you may be in for a rude awakening. The first thing you're likely to run into is the speed of execution. A lot of your tests will start to fail when you point them at either Chrome or Internet Explorer, and likely for different reasons.

Chrome execution can sometimes be faster than Firefox, so you could see some odd timeout failures. This is an indicator that you need to add explicit waits to parts of your page objects that don't already have them. And the inverse is true when running things against older version of Internet Explorer (e.g., IE 8, 9, etc.). This is an indicator that your explicit wait times are not long enough since the browser is taking longer to respond -- so your tests timeout.

The best approach to solve this is an iterative one. Run your tests in a target browser and see which ones fail. Take each failed test, adjust your code as needed, and re-run it against the target browser until they all pass. Repeat for each browser you care about until everything is green.

## Closing Thoughts

By explicitly waiting to complete an action, our tests are in a much more resilient position because Selenium will keep trying for a reasonable amount of time rather than trying just once. And each action can be tuned to meet the needs of each circumstance. Couple that with the dynamic nature of explicit waits, and you have something that will work in a multitude of circumstances -- helping you endure even the toughest of browsers to automate.

This is one of the most important concepts in testing with Selenium. Use explicits waits often.
