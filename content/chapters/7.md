# Verifying Your Locators

If you're fortunate enough to be working with unique IDs and Classes, then you're usually all set. But when you have to handle more complex actions like traversing a page, or you need to run down odd test behavior, it can be a real challenge to verify that you have the right locators to accomplish what you want.

Instead of the painful and tedious process of trying out various locators in your tests until you get what you're looking for, give something like Firefinder a try.

[Firefinder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefinder-for-firebug/) is an add-on to the popular web-development Firefox tool [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/).

You first need to install Firebug, then Firefinder. Once you have it, verifying locators is a trivial task. And it works for both CSS and XPath locators.

__NOTE: An alternative to FireFinder is [FirePath](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firepath/). If you have problems with FireFinder, or if you just want to see which one works better for you, then give it a try.__

## An Example

Let's try to identify the locators necessary to traverse a few levels into a large set of nested divs.

```html
# a snippet from http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/large

<div id='siblings'>
  <div id='sibling-1.1'>1.1
  <div id='sibling-1.2'>1.2</div>
  <div id='sibling-1.3'>1.3</div>
    <div id='sibling-2.1'>2.1
    <div id='sibling-2.2'>2.2</div>
    <div id='sibling-2.2'>2.3</div>
      <div id='sibling-3.1'>3.1
      <div id='sibling-3.2'>3.2</div>
      <div id='sibling-3.2'>3.3</div>
        <div id='sibling-3.1'>4.1
        <div id='sibling-3.2'>4.2</div>
        <div id='sibling-3.2'>4.3</div>
        ...
```

If we perform a `findElement` action using the following locator, it works.

```java
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("div#siblings > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(1)"));
```

But if we try to go one level deeper with the same strategy, it won't work.

```java
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("div#siblings > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(1)"));
```

Fortunately with Firefinder we can actually see what our locators are doing. Here's what it shows us for the locators that "worked".

It looks like our locators are scoping to the wrong part of the first level (1.2). We need to reference the third part of each level (e.g., 1.3, 2.3, 3.3) in order to traverse deeper since the nested divs live under the third part of each level.

So if we try this locator instead, it should work.

```ruby
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("div#siblings > div:nth-of-type(1) > div:nth-of-type(3) > div:nth-of-type(3)"));
```

And we can confirm that it works before changing any test code by looking in Firefinder.

This should help save you time and frustration when running down tricky locators in your tests. It definitely has for me.
