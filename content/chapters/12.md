# Running A Different Browser Locally

It's straightforward to get your tests running locally against Firefox (that's what we've been doing up until now). But when you want to run them against a different browser like Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer you quickly run into configuration overhead that can seem overly complex and lacking in good documentation or examples.

## A Brief Primer On Browser Drivers

With the introduction of WebDriver (circa Selenium 2) a lot of benefits were realized (e.g., more effective and faster browser execution, no more single host origin issues, etc). But with it came some architectural and configuration differences that may not be widely known. Namely -- browser drivers.

WebDriver works with each of the major browsers through a browser driver which is (ideally but not always) maintained by the browser manufacturer. It is an executable file (consider it a thin layer or a shim) that acts as a bridge between Selenium and the browser.

Let's step through an example using [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

## An Example

Before starting, we'll need to [download the latest ChromeDriver binary executable from Google](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) and store the unzipped contents of it somewhere. The simplest thing to do is create a new folder for it (and other things like it) in our test code.

Let's create a `vendor` in the root of our project and place the ChromeDriver binary file there.

```
.
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   └── test
│       └── java
│           ├── pageobjects
│           │   ├── Base.java
│           │   ├── DynamicLoading.java
│           │   └── Login.java
│           └── tests
│               ├── Base.java
│               ├── Config.java
│               ├── TestDynamicLoading.java
│               └── TestLogin.java
└── vendor
    └── chromedriver
```

In order for Selenium to use this binary, we have to make sure it knows where it is. There are two ways to do that. We can add the `chromedriver` file to the path of our system, or we can pass in the path to the `chromedriver` file when configuring Selenium. For simplicity, let's go with the latter option.

We'll also want to make sure our test suite can run either Firefox or Chrome. To do that, we'll need to make a couple of changes.

First, let's add a `browser` variable to our `Config` interface.

```java
// filename: tests/Config.java

package tests;

public interface Config {
    final String baseUrl = System.getProperty("baseUrl", "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");
    final String browser = System.getProperty("browser", "firefox");
}
```

Just like with the `baseUrl`, we'll fetch a runtime property of the same name. If one isn't provided, we'll use a sensible default (e.g., `"firefox"`).

Now we need to update the Selenium setup in our base test.

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java
...
public class Base implements Config {
...
        @Override
        protected void before() throws Throwable {
            if (browser.equals("firefox")) {
                driver = new FirefoxDriver();
            } else if (browser.equals("chrome")) {
                System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver",
                        System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/vendor/chromedriver");
                driver = new ChromeDriver();
            }
        }
```

After implementing `Config` (e.g., `public class Base implements Config`) we're able to access our new `browser` variable. So we put it to use with some conditional checks. If its set to `firefox` then we'll launch an instance of Firefox. If its set to `chrome` we tell Selenium where the `chromedriver` binary lives and then launch an instance of Chrome.

Now when we run our tests, we can specify Chrome as our browser at runtime (e.g., `mvn clean test -Dbrowser=chrome` from the command-line). And if we don't specify a browser, Firefox will be used.

It's worth noting that this will only be reasonably performant since it is launching and terminating the ChromeDriver binary executable before and after every test. There are alternative ways to set this up, but this is good enough to see where our tests fall down in Chrome (and it will not be the primary way we will run our tests a majority of the time -- more on that later in the book).

## Additional Browsers

A similar approach can be applied to other browser drivers, with the only real limitation being the operating system you're running. But remember -- __no two browser drivers are alike__. Be sure to check out the documentation for the browser you care about to find out the specific requirements:
