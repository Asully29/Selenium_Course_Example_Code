# Waiting

## Implicit Wait

+ Specify a timeout during test setup (in milliseconds)
+ For every action that Selenium is unable to complete it will retry it until either:
  + the action can be accomplished, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception (typically `NoSuchElementError`)
+ Less flexible than explicit waits
+ Not recommended

```javascript
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(15000);
```

## Explicit Waits

+ Recommended way to wait in your tests
+ Specify an amount of time (in milliseconds) and an action
+ Selenium will try the action repeatedly until either:
  + the action can be accomplished, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception

```javascript
var Until = require('selenium-webdriver').until;
driver.wait(Until.elementLocated(locator), 15000);
```
