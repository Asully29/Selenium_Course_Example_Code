# Writing Your First Test

Fundamentally, Selenium works with two pieces of information -- the element on a page you want to use and what you want to do with it. This one-two punch will be repeated over and over until you achieve the outcome you want in your application -- at which point you will perform an assertion to confirm that the result is what you intended.

Let's take logging in to a website as an example. With Selenium you would:

1. Visit the login page of a site
2. Find the login form's username field and input the username
3. Find the login form's password field and input the password
4. Find the submit button and click it

Selenium is able to find and interact with elements on a page by way of various locator strategies. The list includes (sorted alphabetically):

+ Class
+ CSS Selector
+ ID
+ Link Text
+ Name
+ Partial Link Text
+ Tag Name
+ XPath

While each serves a purpose, you only need to know a few to start writing effective tests.

## How To Find Locators

The simplest way to find locators is to inspect the elements on a page. The best way to do this is from within your web browser. Fortunately, popular browsers come pre-loaded with development tools that make this simple to accomplish.

When viewing the page, __right-click__ on the element you want to interact with and click __Inspect Element__. This will bring up a small window with all of the markup for the page but zoomed into your highlighted selection. From here you can see if there are unique or descriptive attributes you can work with.

## How To Find Quality Elements

You want to find an element that is __unique__, __descriptive__, and __unlikely to change__.

Ripe candidates for this are `id` and `class` attributes. Whereas text (e.g., the text of a link) is less ideal since it is more apt to change. This may not hold true for when you make assertions, but it's a good goal to strive for.

If the elements you are attempting to work with don't have unique `id` or `class` attributes directly on them, look at the element that houses them (a.k.a. the parent element). Oftentimes the parent element has a unique element that you can use to start with and walk down to the child element you want to use.

When you can't find any unique elements have a conversation with your development team letting them know what you are trying to accomplish. It's typically a trivial thing for them to add helpful semantic markup to a page to make it more testable. This is especially true when they know the use case you're trying to automate. The alternative can be a lengthy and painful process which will probably yield working test code but it will be brittle and hard to maintain.

Once you've identified the target elements for your test, you need to craft a locator using one Selenium's strategies.

## An Example

### Part 1: Find The Elements And Write The Test

Here's the markup for a standard login form (pulled from [the login example on the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login)).

```html
<form name="login" id="login" action="/authenticate" method="post">
   <div class="row">
    <div class="large-6 small-12 columns">
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="large-6 small-12 columns">
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password">
    </div>
  </div>
    <button class="radius" type="submit"><i class="icon-2x icon-signin"> Login</i></button>
</form>
```

Note the unique elements on the form. The username input field has a unique `id`, as does the password input field. The submit button doesn't, but it's the only button on the page so we can easily find it and click it.

Let's put these elements to use in our first test. First we'll need to create a new folder called `Tests` in the root of our project directory. In it we'll create a new test file `LoginTest.cs`. When we're done our directory structure should look like this.

```text
├── Tests
│   └── LoginTest.cs
└── packages.config
```

_NOTE: Other items in the directory have been omitted for brevity (and will continue to be omitted for the remainder of the book). Things like the `Properties` directory (and its `AssemblyInfo.cs` file) as well as the project and solutions files (e.g., `SeleniumGuidebookExamples.csproj` and `SeleniumGuidebookExamples.sln`. The name for your project may be different depending on what you named it up its creation._

And here is the code we will add to the test file for our Selenium commands, locators, etc.

```csharp
//filename: Tests/LoginTest.cs
using NUnit.Framework;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;

namespace Tests
{
    [TestFixture]
    class LoginTest
    {
        IWebDriver Driver;

        [SetUp]
        public void SetUp()
        {
            Driver = new FirefoxDriver();
        }

        [TearDown]
        public void TearDown()
        {
            Driver.Quit();
        }

        [Test]
        public void ValidAccount()
        {
            Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login");
            Driver.FindElement(By.Id("username")).SendKeys("tomsmith");
            Driver.FindElement(By.Id("password")).SendKeys("SuperSecretPassword!");
            Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("button")).Click();
        }
    }
}
```

After including the requisite classes for NUnit and Selenium we declare a class (e.g., `public class LoginTest` and add an attribute to it that denotes that this is a test class (e.g., `[TestFixtures]`). We then declare a field variable to store and reference an instance of Selenium WebDriver (e.g., `IWebDriver Driver;`).

Next we add setup and teardown methods with the attributes `[SetUp]` and `[TearDown]`. In them we're creating an instance of Selenium (storing it in `Driver`) and closing it (e.g., `Driver.Quit();`). Because of the `[SetUp]` attribute, the `public void SetUp()` method will load before our test and the `[TearDown]` attribute will make the `public void TearDown()` method load after the test. This abstraction enables us to write our test with a focus on the behavior we want to exercise in the browser, rather than clutter it up with setup and teardown details.

Our test is a method as well (`public void ValidAccount()`). NUnit knows this is a test because of the `[Test]` attribute. In this test we're visiting the login page by its URL (with `Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl()`), finding the input fields by their ID (with `Driver.FindElement(By.Id())`), inputting text into them (with `.SendKeys();`), and submitting the form by clicking the submit button (e.g., `By.CssSelector("button")).Click();`).

If we save this and run it (by clicking `Test`, `Run`, `All Tests` or `CTRL` + `R`, `A`), it will run and pass. But there's one thing missing -- an assertion. In order to find an element to write an assertion against we need to see what the markup of the page is after submitting the login form.

### Part 2: Figure Out What To Assert

Here is the markup that renders on the page after logging in.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div id="flash-messages" class="large-12 columns">
    <div data-alert="" id="flash" class="flash success">
      You logged into a secure area!
      <a href="#" class="close">x</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="content" class="large-12 columns">
  <div class="example">
    <h2><i class="icon-lock"></i> Secure Area</h2>
    <h4 class="subheader">Welcome to the Secure Area. When you are done click logout below.</h4>
    <a class="button secondary radius" href="/logout"><i class="icon-2x icon-signout"> Logout</i></a>
  </div>
</div>
```

There are a couple of elements we can use for our assertion in this markup. There's the flash message class (most appealing), the logout button (appealing), or the copy from either the `h2` or the flash message (least appealing).

Since the flash message class name is descriptive, denotes a successful login, and is less likely to change than the copy, let's go with that.

```html
class="flash success"
```

When we try to access an element like this (e.g., with a multi-worded class) we will need to use a CSS selector or an XPath.

_NOTE: Both CSS selectors and XPath work well, but the examples throughout this book will focus on how to use CSS selectors._

## A Quick Primer on CSS Selectors

In web design CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to apply styles to the markup (HTML) on a page. CSS is able to do this by declaring which bits of the markup it wants to alter through the use of selectors. Selenium operates in a similar manner but instead of changing the style of elements, it interacts with them by clicking, getting values, typing, sending keys, etc.

CSS selectors are a pretty straightforward and handy way to write locators, especially for hard to reach elements.

For right now, here's what you need to know. In CSS, class names start with a dot (`.`). For classes with multiple words, put a dot in front of __each__ word, and remove the space between them (e.g., `.flash.success` for `class='flash success'`).

For a good resource on CSS Selectors I encourage you to check out [Sauce Labs' write up on them](https://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium/css-selectors).

### Part 3: Write The Assertion And Verify It

Now that we have our locator, let's add an assertion that uses it.

```csharp
//filename: tests/LoginTest.cs
// ...
        [Test]
        public void ValidAccount()
        {
            Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login");
            Driver.FindElement(By.Id("username")).SendKeys("tomsmith");
            Driver.FindElement(By.Id("password")).SendKeys("SuperSecretPassword!");
            Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("button")).Click();
            Assert.That(Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(".flash.success")).Displayed);
        }
    }
}
```


With `Assert.That` we are checking for a `true` Boolean response. If one is not received the test will fail. With Selenium we are seeing if the success message element is displayed on the page (with `.Displayed`). This Selenium command returns a Boolean. So if the element is rendered on the page and is visible (e.g., not hidden or covered up by an overlay), `true` will be returned, and our test will pass.

When we save this and run it it will run and pass just like before, but now there is an assertion which will catch a failure if something is amiss.

### Just To Make Sure

Just to make certain that this test is doing what we think it should, let's change the locator in the assertion to attempt to __force a failure__ and run it again. A simple fudging of the locator will suffice.

```csharp
            Assert.That(Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(".flash.successasdf")).Displayed);
```

If it fails then we can feel reasonably confident that the test is doing what we expect and we can change the assertion back to normal before committing our code.

This trick will save you more trouble that you know. Practice it often.
