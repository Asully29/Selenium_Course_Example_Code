# Speeding Up Your Test Runs

We've made huge strides by leveraging page objects, a base page object, explicit waits, and connecting our tests to Sauce Labs. But we're not done yet. Our tests still take a good deal of time to run since they're executing in series (e.g., one after another). As our suite grows this slowness will grow with it.

With parallelization we can easily remedy this pain before it becomes acute by executing multiple tests at the same time. And with [the Maven Surefire Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/) it's extremely simple to setup.

## Part 1: Setup

The setup for the Maven Surefire Plugin starts and ends in the `pom.xml` file. To install and configure it we need to add the following.

```java
// filename: pom.xml
...
    <build>
        <pluginManagement>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.18.1</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <parallel>classesAndMethods</parallel>
                        <threadCount>5</threadCount>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
    </build>

</project>
```

Notice that there's no `<dependency>` section for installing this library. Everything is handled within the `<build><pluginManagement>` section. And aside from specifying a `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` we have a `configuration` section. In this section we've set the type of `parallel` execution we want (e.g., `classesAndMethods`) along with the number of concurrent threads we'd like to use (e.g., `5`).

When we save this file and run our tests (e.g., `mvn clean test`) we'll see multiple browsers launch at the same time -- completing a run through all of the tests at a much faster rate than before.

## Part 2: Randomizing

When enabling parallel execution in your tests you may start to see odd, inconsistent behavior that is hard to track down.

This is often due to dependencies between tests that you didn't know were there. A great way to expose these kinds of issues and ensure your tests are ready for prime time is to execute them in a random order. This also has the added benefit of exercising the application you're testing in a random order (which could unearth previously unnoticed issues).

To set this up in our test suite is another small change. We have to add a new library called `random-jUnit` and add it to our base test class.

```java
// filename: pom.xml
...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.sf.randomjunit</groupId>
            <artifactId>random-jUnit</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.2</version>
        </dependency>

    </dependencies>
...
```

This library requires no additional configuration in the `pom.xml`. It's just a standard installation.

Now to modify the base test class.

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java
...
import net.sf.randomjunit.RandomTestRunner;

@RunWith(RandomTestRunner.class)
public class Base implements Config {
...
```

After importing the library we use JUnit's `@RunWith` annotation to use the `RandomTestRunner.class` made available by the library.

Now when we run our tests (e.g., `mvn clean test` from the command-line) they will run in a random order.
