# Speeding Up Your Test Runs

We've made huge strides by leveraging page objects, a base page object, explicit waits, and connecting our tests to Sauce Labs. But we're not done yet. Our tests still take a good deal of time to run since they're executing in series (e.g., one after another). As our suite grows this slowness will grow with it.

With parallelization we can easily remedy this pain before it becomes acute by executing multiple tests at the same time. And with what's built into NUnit it's extremely simple to do.

## Configuration

For each test class we need to add an attribute to it that denotes that it should be run in parallel.

```csharp
// filename: Tests/LoginTest.cs
// ...
namespace Tests
{
    [TestFixture]
    [Parallelizable]
    class LoginTest : BaseTest
    {
// ...
```

```csharp
// filename: Tests/DynamicLoadingTest.cs
// ...
namespace Tests
{
    [TestFixture]
    [Parallelizable]
    class DynamicLoadingTest : BaseTest
    {
// ...
```

Adding the `[Parallelizable]` attribute before the class declaration for each test is all that's needed. When we save everything and run our tests from within Visual Studio we'll see multiple browsers launch at the same time -- completing a run through all of the tests at a faster rate than before.

## One Drawback

Just because we have 4 tests does not mean we will have 4 parallel threads running at the same time. In NUnit parallel execution is only supported at the fixture (a.k.a. test class) level.

So instead of 4 threads, we'll get 2 (one for `LoginTest.cs` and another for `DynamicLoadingTest.cs`). A single thread will execute all of the test methods within a fixture one-at-a-time (rather than all at once).
