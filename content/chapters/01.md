# Local Configuration

## Firefox

The FirefoxDriver comes built into the Selenium language bindings. It's a simple matter of requesting a new instance of it.

```javascript
var driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('firefox').build();
```

__NOTE: For more information about FirefoxDriver check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for FirefoxDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver)__

## Chrome

In order to use Chrome you need to download the ChromeDriver binary for your operating system from [here](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) (pick the highest number for the latest version). You either need to manually add it to your System Path or add to the System Path for the current terminal session.

```javascript
process.env.PATH = '/path/to/chromedriver/folder' + ":$PATH";
var driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
```

__NOTE: For more information about ChromeDriver check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for ChromeDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)__

## Internet Explorer

For Internet Explorer on Windows you need to download the IEDriverServer.exe from [here](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) (pick the highest number for the latest version) and either manually add it to your System Path or add to the System Path for the current terminal session.

```javascript
var driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('ie').build();
```

__NOTE: As of July 19, 2016 Internet Explorer 8 and older are no longer supported by the Selenium project. Also, if you're trying to run Windows 11 then you will need to add a registry key to your system. For more information about this and other InternetExplorerDriver details check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for InternetExplorerDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver).__

## Edge

In order to use Microsoft Edge you need to have access to Windows 10. You can download a free virtual machine with it from Microsoft for testing purposes from [Microsoft's Modern.IE developer portal](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). After that you need to download the appropriate `Microsoft WebDriver` server for your build of Windows. To find that go to `Start`, `Settings`, `System`, `About` and locate the number next to `OS Build` on the screen. Then it's just a simple matter of requesting a new instance of Edge.

```javascript
var driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('edge').build();
```

__NOTE: Currently Edge is only supported in the C#, Java, and JavaScript bindings. For more information about EdgeDriver check out [the main page on the Microsoft Developer portal](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/dev-guide/tools/webdriver/) and [the download page for the EdgeDriver binary](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).__

## Safari

To use Safari you need to download and install a SafariDriver browser extension for Selenium which you can get from [this direct download link from the Selenium project](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.48/SafariDriver.safariextz).

```javascript
var driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('safari').build();
```

__NOTE: There is no Selenium support for Safari on Windows. For more information about SafariDriver check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for SafariDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/SafariDriver)__

## Opera

Versions 15 and new of Opera are built from the same rendering engine as Chrome. So if you run your tests with ChromeDriver then you are essentially testing Opera too.

There are some slight differences with it though. So if you have a business need to test with Opera, be sure to check out the [OperaChromiumDriver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver) for current versions of Opera and the [OperaPrestoDriver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operaprestodriver) for older versions of Opera.
