# Local Configuration

## Firefox

The FirefoxDriver comes built into the Selenium language bindings. It's a simple matter of requesting a new instance of it.

```python
driver = webdriver.Firefox()
```

## Firefox

1. Download the latest geckodriver binary from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest)
2. Add it to your path, or tell Selenium where to find it
3. Create an instance of Firefox

```python
from selenium import webdriver
_geckodriver = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'vendor', 'geckodriver')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=_geckodriver)
```

To use the legacy FirefoxDriver:

1. Specify desired capabilities with `marionette` set to `False`
2. Pass in the desired capabilities when creating an instance of Firefox

```python
driver = webdriver.Firefox(capabilities={'marionette': False})
```

__NOTE: For more information about FirefoxDriver check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for FirefoxDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver) and [the Mozilla project page for geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver)__


## Chrome

In order to use Chrome you need to download the ChromeDriver binary for your operating system from [here](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) (pick the highest number for the latest version). You either need to add it to your System Path or specify its location as part of your test setup.

```python
driver = webdriver.Chrome("/path/to/chromedriver")
```

__NOTE: For more information about ChromeDriver check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for ChromeDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)__

## Internet Explorer

For Internet Explorer on Windows you need to download the IEDriverServer.exe from [here](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) (pick the highest number for the latest version) and either add it to your System Path or specify its location as part of your test setup.

```python
driver = webdriver.Ie("/path/to/IEDriverServer.exe")
```

__NOTE: As of July 19, 2016 Internet Explorer 8 and older are no longer supported by the Selenium project. Also, if you're trying to run Windows 11 then you will need to add a registry key to your system. For more information about this and other InternetExplorerDriver details check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for InternetExplorerDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver).__

## Edge

In order to use Microsoft Edge you need to have access to Windows 10. You can download a free virtual machine with it from Microsoft for testing purposes from [Microsoft's Modern.IE developer portal](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). After that you need to download the appropriate `Microsoft WebDriver` server for your build of Windows. To find that go to `Start`, `Settings`, `System`, `About` and locate the number next to `OS Build` on the screen. Then it's just a simple matter of requesting a new instance of Edge.

```python
driver = webdriver.Edge();
```

__NOTE: Currently Edge is only supported in the C#, Java, and JavaScript bindings. For more information about EdgeDriver check out [the main page on the Microsoft Developer portal](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/dev-guide/tools/webdriver/) and [the download page for the EdgeDriver binary](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).__

## Safari

Safari on OSX works for Python if you download the Selenium Standalone Server (which you can get from [here](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/)) and specify the path to it in an environment variable called `SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR`. You also need to download and install a SafariDriver browser extension which you can get from [this direct download link from the Selenium project](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.48/SafariDriver.safariextz).

```python
import os
os.environment["SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR"] = "/path/to/jar/file"
driver = webdriver.Safari();
```

__NOTE: There is no Selenium support for Safari on Windows. For more information about SafariDriver check out [the Selenium project Wiki page for SafariDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/SafariDriver)__

## Opera

Versions 15 and new of Opera are built from the same rendering engine as Chrome. So if you run your tests with ChromeDriver then you are essentially testing Opera too.

There are some slight differences with it though. So if you have a business need to test with Opera, be sure to check out the [OperaChromiumDriver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver) for current versions of Opera and the [OperaPrestoDriver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operaprestodriver) for older versions of Opera.
