# Prepping For Use

Now that we have some tests and page objects, we'll want to start thinking about how to structure our test code to be more flexible. That way it can scale to meet our needs.

## Part 1: Global Setup & Teardown

We'll start by pulling the Selenium setup and teardown out of our tests and into a central location.

In pytest there is a central file that we can use for this called `conftest.py` that will automatically be found and used during test execution. So let's create a new file called `conftest.py` in the `tests` directory.

```text
├── pages
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base_page.py
│   ├── dynamic_loading_page.py
│   ├── login_page.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── conftest.py
    ├── dynamic_loading_test.py
    └── login_test.py
└── vendor
    └── geckodriver
```

And here are the contents of the file.

```python
# filename: tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from selenium import webdriver


@pytest.fixture
def driver(request):
    driver_ = webdriver.Firefox()

    def quit():
        driver_.quit()

    request.addfinalizer(quit)
    return driver_
```

After importing the necessary classes for pytest and Selenium we specify the fixture setup and teardown code that we used directly in our tests.

Now let's update our tests to clean up the fixtures and remove any unnecessary `import` statements. When we're done our test files should look like this.

```python
# filename: tests/login_test.py
import pytest
from pages import login_page


class TestLogin():

    @pytest.fixture
    def login(self, driver):
        return login_page.LoginPage(driver)

    def test_valid_credentials(self, login):
        login.with_("tomsmith", "SuperSecretPassword!")
        assert login.success_message_present()

    def test_invalid_credentials(self, login):
        login.with_("tomsmith", "bad password")
        assert login.failure_message_present()
```

```python
# filename: tests/dynamic_loading_test.py
import pytest
from pages import dynamic_loading_page


class TestDynamicLoading():

    @pytest.fixture
    def dynamic_loading(self, driver):
        return dynamic_loading_page.DynamicLoadingPage(driver)

    def test_hidden_element(self, dynamic_loading):
        dynamic_loading.load_example("1")
        assert dynamic_loading.finish_text_present()

    def test_rendered_element(self, dynamic_loading):
        dynamic_loading.load_example("2")
        assert dynamic_loading.finish_text_present()
```

## Part 2: Base URL

It's a given that we'll need to run our tests against different environments (e.g., local, test, staging, production, etc.). So let's make it so we can specify a different base URL for our tests at runtime.

First, let's create a file called `config.py` in the `tests` directory.

```text
├── pages
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base_page.py
│   ├── dynamic_loading_page.py
│   ├── login_page.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── config.py
    ├── conftest.py
    ├── dynamic_loading_test.py
    └── login_test.py
└── vendor
    └── geckodriver
```

In it we'll specify an empty placeholder variable for `baseurl` that we'll use in `conftest.py`.

```python
baseurl = ""
```

Now let's update our our test fixture in `conftest.py` to enable a command-line argument for a base URL and store the received value in the placeholder variable in `config.py`.

```python
# filename: tests/conftest.py
# ...
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    parser.addoption("--baseurl",
                     action="store",
                     default="http://the-internet.herokuapp.com",
                     help="base URL for the application under test")


@pytest.fixture
def driver(request):
    config.baseurl = request.config.getoption("--baseurl")
# ...
```

There's a nice helper method in pytest called `pytest_addoption(parser)`. It enables us to specify a custom runtime flag and set a sensible default. This value gets passed into the `request` variable that is available in our test fixture. So we can easily pluck the value out of it and store it in `config.baseurl`.

Now we are able to use the base URL in other parts of our test code, like our Base Page Object.

```python
# filename: pages/base_page.py
from tests import config
# ...
    def _visit(self, url):
        if url.startswith("http"):
            self.driver.get(url)
        else:
            self.driver.get(config.baseurl + url)
# ...
```

In `_visit` there could be a case where we'll want to navigate to a full URL so to be safe we've added a conditional check of the `url` parameter to see if a full URL was passed in. If so, we'll visit it. If not, the `config.baserl` will be combined with the URL path that was passed in to `url` to create a full URL.

Now all we need to do is update our page objects so they're no longer using hard-coded URLs when calling `_visit`.

```python
# filename: pages/login_page.py
# ...
    def __init__(self, driver):
        self.driver = driver
        self._visit("/login")
        assert self._is_displayed(self._login_form)
# ...
```

```python
# filename: pages/dynamic_loading_page.py
# ...
    def load_example(self, example_number):
        self._visit("/dynamic_loading/" + example_number)
        self._click(self._start_button)
# ...
```

## Outro

Now when running our tests, we can specify a different base URL by providing an extra command-line flag (e.g., `py.test --baseurl=url`). We're also in a better position now with our setup and teardown abstracted into a central location. Now we can easily extend our test framework to run our tests on other browsers.
