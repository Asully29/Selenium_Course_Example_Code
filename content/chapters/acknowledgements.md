# Acknowledgements

Writing this book in Java was always something I thought about doing. But it wasn't until some thoughtful encouragement from Ravi Gupta that I finally made up my mind to do it. Thanks Ravi, I hope this was what you were looking for.

Also a huge thanks to Ravi Gupta, Jonathan Taylor, Matthew Edwards, Josh Grant, and Brian Goad for offering to review my initial code earlier this year, providing constructive feedback, and acting as a general sounding board. No matter the amount of effort you provided (big or small), this book is better as a result. Thank you!

With this updated edition I'd also like to thank the following readers (sorted alphabetically by last name):

- Matt Allen
- Benjamin Limb
- Myroslav Oleinykov
- Mark Winspear

Matt, Benjamin, Myroslav, and Mark -- your feedback has helped refine the book into something much more clear and concise than it was before. I'm thrilled that you got so much out of reading it and provided so much great feedback in return.

And lastly I'd like to thank you, the reader. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have started writing about Selenium years ago -- let alone consider porting my book into other programming languages. Thanks for reading! I hope you find it useful in your daily work.


Cheers,
