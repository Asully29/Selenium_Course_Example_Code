# Writing Really Re-usable Test Code

In the previous chapter we stepped through creating a simple page object to capture the behavior of the page we were interacting with. While this was a good start, it leaves some room for improvement.

As our test suite grows and we add more page objects, we will start to see common behavior that we will want to use over and over again throughout our suite. If we leave this unchecked we will end up with duplicative code which will slowly make our test suite harder to maintain. 

Right now we are using Selenium actions directly in our page object. While on the face of it this may seem fine, it has some long term impacts, like:

+ slower page object creation due to the lack of a simple Domain Specific Language (DSL)
+ test maintenance issues when the Selenium API changes (e.g., major changes between Selenium RC and Selenium WebDriver)
+ the inability to swap out the driver for your tests (e.g., mobile)

With a Base Page Object (a.k.a. a facade) we can easily side step these concerns by abstracting all of our common actions into a central class and leverage them in our page objects.

## An Example

Let's step through an example with our login page object.

### Part 1: Create The Base Page Object

First let's create the base page object by adding a file called `Base.java` to the `pageobjects` package in the `src/test/java` directory.

```sh
.
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   └── test
│       └── java
│           ├── pageobjects
│           │   ├── Base.java
│           │   └── Login.java
│           └── tests
│               └── TestLogin.java
```

Next let's populate the file with the necessary import statements and code.

```java
// filename: pageobjects/Base.java

package pageobjects;

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;

public class Base {

    private WebDriver driver;

    public Base(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public void visit(String url) {
        driver.get(url);
    }

    public WebElement find(By locator) {
        return driver.findElement(locator);
    }

    public void click(By locator) {
        find(locator).click();
    }

    public void type(String inputText, By locator) {
        find(locator).sendKeys(inputText);
    }

    public void submit(By locator) {
        find(locator).submit();
    }

    public Boolean isDisplayed(By locator) {
        return find(locator).isDisplayed();
    }

}
```

After declaring the class (e.g., `public class Base`) we receive and store an instance of Selenium just like in our Login page object. But what's different here is the methods that come after the constructor (e.g., `visit`, `find`, `click`, `type`, `submit`, and `isDisplayed`). Each one stores a specific behavior we've used in our tests. Some of the names are the same as you've seen, others renamed (for better readability).

Now that we have all of our Selenium actions in one place, let's update our login page object to leverage this facade.

```java
// filename: pageobjects/Login.java

package pageobjects;

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

public class Login extends Base {

    By usernameLocator  = By.id("username");
    By passwordLocator  = By.id("password");
    By loginFormLocator = By.id("login");
    By successMessageLocator = By.cssSelector(".flash.success");
    By failureMessageLocator = By.cssSelector(".flash.error");

    public Login(WebDriver driver) {
        super(driver);
        visit("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login");
        assertTrue("The login form is not present",
                isDisplayed(loginFormLocator));
    }

    public void with(String username, String password) {
        type(username, usernameLocator);
        type(password, passwordLocator);
        submit(loginFormLocator);
    }

    public Boolean successMessagePresent() {
        return isDisplayed(successMessageLocator);
    }

    public Boolean failureMessagePresent() {
        return isDisplayed(failureMessageLocator);
    }
}
```

Two fundamental things have changed in our Login page object.

First, we've established inheritance between `Base` and `Login` with `public class Login extends Base`. This means that `Login` is now a child of `Base`. Second, we've swapped out all of the Selenium actions to use the methods made available from `Base` thanks to inheritance.

If we save everything and run our tests (e.g., `mvn clean test` from the command-line) then the tests will run and pass just like before. But now, your page objects are more readable, simpler to write, and easier to maintain.

### Part 2: Add Some Error Handling

Remember in the previous chapter when we ran into an error with Selenium when we looked for an element that wasn't on the page? Let's address that now.

To recap -- here's the error message we saw:

```sh
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":".flash.error"}
Command duration or timeout: 123 milliseconds
For documentation on this error, please visit: http://seleniumhq.org/exceptions/no_such_element.html

System info: host: 'asdf', ip: '192.168.1.112', os.name: 'Mac OS X', os.arch: 'x86_64', os.version: '10.10.1', java.version: '1.8.0_25'
Driver info: org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver
Capabilities [{applicationCacheEnabled=true, rotatable=false, handlesAlerts=true, databaseEnabled=true, version=34.0.5, platform=MAC, nativeEvents=false, acceptSslCerts=true, webStorageEnabled=true, locationContextEnabled=true, browserName=firefox, takesScreenshot=true, javascriptEnabled=true, cssSelectorsEnabled=true}]
Session ID: b6648aef-5be5-e542-add1-265ed2a35a65
...
```

The important thing to note is the exception Selenium offered up -- the part that comes just before the line that says `Unable to locate element`. We're interested in `org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException`. With it we can make our test code return a `false` Boolean rather than throw an error.

Let's update the `isDisplayed` method in our base page object to do that.

```java
// filename: pageobjects/Base.java
...
    public Boolean isDisplayed(By locator) {
        try {
            return find(locator).isDisplayed();
        } catch (org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException exception) {
            return false;
        }
    }

}
```

By wrapping our Selenium action (e.g., `return find(locator).isDisplayed();`) in a `try`/`catch` we're able to prevent our test from throwing an exception, returning `false` instead.

With this new exception handling in place let's revisit our `failed()` login test and alter it so it triggers a `NoSuchElementException` (to make sure things are working as we expect).

```java
// filename: tests/TestLogin.java
...
    @Test
    public void failed() {
        login.with("tomsmith", "bad password");
        assertFalse("failure message wasn't present after providing bogus credentials",
                login.successMessagePresent());
    }
...
```

When we save our changes and run the tests (`mvn clean tests` from the command-line) they will all pass.
