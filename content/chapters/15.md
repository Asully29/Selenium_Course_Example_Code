# Flexible Test Execution

In order to get the most out of our tests we'll want a way to break them up into relevant, targeted chunks. Running tests in smaller groupings like this (along with parallel execution) will help keep test run times to a minimum and help enhance the amount of feedback you get in a timely fashion.

With [pytest markers](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/markers.html) we're able to easily achieve test grouping.

Let's step how to set this up.

## Specifying Markers

In order to use custom markers we first have to specify them a `pytest.ini` file. So let's go ahead and create that in the root of our project.

```text
├── pages
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base_page.py
│   ├── dynamic_loading_page.py
│   ├── login_page.py
├── pytest.ini
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── conftest.py
│   ├── dynamic_loading_test.py
│   └── login_test.py
└── vendor
    ├── chromedriver
    └── geckodriver
    └── sc-4.3.16-osx
        ├── bin
        │   ├── sc
        │   └── sc.dSYM
        │       └── Contents
        │           ├── Info.plist
        │           └── Resources
        │               └── DWARF
        │                   └── sc
        ├── include
        │   └── sauceconnect.h
        ├── lib
        │   ├── libsauceconnect.a
        │   └── libsauceconnect.la
        └── license.html
```

In `pytest.ini` file we'll add two no markers and a description for them.

```python
# filename: pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    shallow: Run the most critical tests. Quick to run and exercise the top layer of functionality that matters most to the business
    deep: Run non-critical tests which may take longer to run
```

`shallow` tests are roughly equivalent to "smoke" or "sanity" tests. These should pass before you can consider running other tests which aren't as mission critical and may take longer to run (e.g., `deep` tests).

Now we just need to add decorators for the markers to the tests. They can either be applied at the class level or at the test method level. If they're applied to the class, then all test methods in the class will receive it.

```python
# filename: tests/login_test.py
# ...
    @pytest.mark.shallow
    def test_valid_credentials(self, login):
        login.with_("tomsmith", "SuperSecretPassword!")
        assert login.success_message_present()

    @pytest.mark.deep
    def test_invalid_credentials(self, login):
        login.with_("tomsmith", "bad password")
        assert login.failure_message_present()

# ...
```

In `login_test.py` we marked the happy path test as `shallow` and the invalid credentials test as `deep`. Now let's apply the `deep` marker to the entire class in `dynamic_loading_test.py`.

```python
# filename: tests/dynamic_loading_test.py
# ...
@pytest.mark.deep
class TestDynamicLoading():
# ...
```

Markers are powerful since they can be applied across different test files, enabling you to create a dynamic grouping of tests at runtime.

## Running Markers

With pytest we can specify which marker to launch at runtime. This is handled as another runtime flag on the command-line using `-m`.

Here are the available execution commands given for our current markers:

```text
py.test -m shallow
py.test -m deep
```

For more info on this functionality and other available options, check out the [pytest marker documentation](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/markers.html).
