# Flexible Test Execution

In order to get the most out of our tests we'll want a way to break them up into relevant, targeted chunks. Running tests in smaller groupings like this (along with parallel execution) will help keep test run times to a minimum and help enhance the amount of feedback you get in a timely fashion.

With [NUnit's Category Attribute](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Category-Attribute) we're able to easily achieve test grouping. It's a simple matter of adding the Category Attribute to either a test method or test class along with a helpful name.

Let's step how to set this up.

## Specifying Categories

```csharp
// filename: Tests/LoginTest.cs
// ...
        [Test]
        [Category("Shallow")]
        public void ValidAccount()
        {
            Login.With("tomsmith", "SuperSecretPassword!");
            Assert.That(Login.SuccessMessagePresent);
        }

        [Test]
        [Category("Deep")]
        public void BadPasswordProvided()
        {
            Login.With("tomsmith", "bad password");
            Assert.That(Login.FailureMessagePresent);
        }
// ...
```

```csharp
// filename: Tests/DynamicLoadingTest.cs
// ...
    [TestFixture]
    [Parallelizable]
    [Category("Deep")]
    class DynamicLoadingTest : BaseTest
// ...
```

In both of our test files we've applied two different categories, `"Shallow"` and `"Deep"`. "Shallow" tests are roughly equivalent to "smoke" or "sanity" tests. These should pass before you can consider running other tests which aren't as mission critical and may take longer to run (e.g., "Deep").

Categories are powerful since they can be applied across different test files, enabling you to create a dynamic grouping of tests at runtime.

## Running Categories

With NUnit we can specify which category to launch at runtime. This is handled through the [NUnit Console Runner](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.ConsoleRunner). It enables us to run our tests from the command-line, which will also be helpful when wiring things up to a Continuous Integration Server (which we'll step through in the next chapter).

To run your tests from the command-line, use the following command:

```text
C:\SeleniumGuidebookExamples>packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner\tools\nunit3-console.exe SeleniumGuidebookExamples.sln
```

The `nunit3-console.exe` file lives within the test project under `packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner\tools`. After specifying it we need to provide the solution file for our project.

To run a specific test category we need to append an additional argument, like so:

```text
C:\SeleniumGuidebookExamples>packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner\tools\nunit3-console.exe SeleniumGuidebookExamples.sln --where:cat==Shallow
```

Here are the available execution commands given for our current categories:

```text
packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.2.1\tools\nunit3-console.exe SeleniumGuidebookExamples.sln --where:cat==Shallow

packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.2.1\tools\nunit3-console.exe SeleniumGuidebookExamples.sln --where:cat==Deep
```
