# Flexible Test Execution

In order to get the most out of our tests we'll want a way to break them up into relevant, targeted chunks. Running tests in smaller groupings like this (along with parallel execution) will help keep test run times to a minimum and help enhance the amount of feedback you get in a timely fashion.

With [Mocha's `--grep` feature](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/Tagging) we're able to easily achieve test grouping (a.k.a. tags).

Let's step how to set this up.

## Specifying Tags

Grep is a simple text match function. It will look through the test files and execute them based on if it found a match or not. To make this helpful we'll want to specify simple names as meta-data which are prepended with a special character to denote that this is what they are.

Some simple examples of this are `@shallow` and `@deep`. `@shallow` tests are roughly equivalent to "smoke" or "sanity" tests. These should pass before you can consider running other tests which aren't as mission critical and may take longer to run (e.g., `@deep` tests).

Let's update our tests to apply these "tags".

```javascript
// filename: test/LoginTest.js
// ...
  test.it('with valid credentials @shallow', function() {
    login.with('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!');
    login.successMessagePresent().then(function(elementDisplayed) {
      assert.equal(elementDisplayed, true, 'Success message not displayed');
    });
  });

  test.it('with invalid credentials @deep', function() {
    login.with('tomsmith', 'bad password');
    login.failureMessagePresent().then(function(elementDisplayed) {
      assert.equal(elementDisplayed, true, 'Failure message not displayed');
    });
  });
// ...
```

In `LoginTest.js` we updated the test names directly. The happy path test is now marked as `@shallow` and the invalid credentials test as `@deep`. Now let's apply the `@deep` marker to the entire class in `DynamicLoadingTest.js`.

```javascript
// filename: test/DynamicLoadingTest.js
// ...
test.describe('Dynamic Loading @deep', function() {
// ...
```

Tags are powerful since they can be applied across different test files, enabling you to create a dynamic grouping of tests at runtime.

## Running Markers

With Mocha we can specify which marker to launch at runtime. This is handled as another runtime flag on the command-line using `--grep`. But in order to use it in the context of our parallel execution we'll need to update our Gruntfile.

```javascript
// filename: Gruntfile.js
// ...
    grunt.initConfig({
      shell: {
        runTests: {
          command: function(testFile, testOptions) {
            return 'mocha test/'+testFile+' '+testOptions+'';
          }
        }
      },
// ...
    var tag = grunt.option('tag'),
        testOptions = '';

    if (tag) {
      testOptions = '--grep '+tag+'';
    }

    testFiles.forEach(function(testFile) {
        grunt.registerTask(testFile, ['shell:runTests:'+testFile+':'+testOptions+'']);
    });
};
```

First we updated our `shell` execution command to take another argument for `testOptions`. We then specified a Grunt run-time option so we can specify a tag when running our tests. If we provide one, then we store it in `testOptions` and pass it into our `shell` tasks so they get executed with our test suite.

Now we can run our tests with tags by specifying `--tag=tag-name`.

```text
mocha --tag=@shallow
```
