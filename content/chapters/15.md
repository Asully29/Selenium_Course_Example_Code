# Flexible Test Execution

In order to get the most out of our tests, we'll want a way to break them up into relevant, targeted chunks. Running tests in smaller groupings like this (along with parallel execution) will help keep test run times to a minimum and help enhance the amount of feedback you get in a timely fashion.

With JUnit's [Categories](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Categories) we're able to easily achieve test grouping. We first need to specify the categories we want to use, and then place a test (or set of tests) into a category. We can then specify which group of tests to run by specifying a category at runtime.

Let's step how to set this up.

## Part 1: Creating Categories

Each category we want will need to have its own interface. So let's create a new package called `groups` inside of the `tets` package. Inside `groups` we'll create three interface files -- `All.java`, `Deep.java`, and `Shallow.java`.

"Shallow" tests are equivalent to "smoke" (or "sanity") tests. These should pass before you can consider running other (e.g., "Deep") tests. Whereas "All" simply means all tests.

```text
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   └── test
│       └── java
│           ├── pageobjects
│           │   ├── Base.java
│           │   ├── DynamicLoading.java
│           │   └── Login.java
│           └── tests
│               ├── Base.java
│               ├── Config.java
│               ├── TestDynamicLoading.java
│               ├── TestLogin.java
│               └── groups
│                   ├── All.java
│                   ├── Deep.java
│                   └── Shallow.java
```

Next, we'll populate the interface files.

```java
// filename: tests/groups/All.java

package tests.groups;

public interface All { }

```

```java
// filename: tests/groups/Deep.java

package tests.groups;

public interface Deep extends All { }

```

```java
// filename: tests/groups/Shallow.java

package tests.groups;

public interface Shallow extends All { }

```

Since we can establish inheritance with interfaces (just like in classes), it's easy enough to connect one category with another. So for these categories, we've made it so `Deep` and `Shallow` are children of `All`. This way we can not only execute a subset of tests, but all tests if we wanted.

## Part 2: Specifying Categories

Now that we have category interfaces created, we can add them to our tests. This can either be done on individual tests, or at the class level.

```java
// filename: tests/TestLogin.java
...
import org.junit.experimental.categories.Category;
import tests.groups.Shallow;
...
    @Test
    @Category(Shallow.class)
    public void succeeded() {
...
    @Test
    @Category(Shallow.class)
    public void failed() {
...
```

```java
// filename: tests/TestDynamicLoading.java
...
import org.junit.experimental.categories.Category;
import tests.groups.Deep;

@Category(Deep.class)
public class TestDynamicLoading extends Base {
...
```

Keep in mind that we can apply the same category to different tests across numerous files. That's just now how they were applied in this case.

## Part 3: Running Categories

Before we can run our tests with these categories, we need to make it so we can specify a category as a runtime property. For that, we'll modify `pom.xml`.

```java
// filename: pom.xml
...
    <properties>
        <groups>tests.groups.Shallow</groups>
    </properties>

    <build>
        <pluginManagement>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.18.1</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <parallel>classesAndMethods</parallel>
                        <threadCount>5</threadCount>
                        <groups>${groups}</groups>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
    </build>

</project>
```

Within the Maven Surefire Plugin we can specify which categories we want to run in the `<configuration><groups>` option of the `pom.xml`.

Under normal circumstances this would be a static value that would run every time. But we're able to achieve more flexibility at runtime by specifying a `<groups>` value under `<properties>`. This specifies a runtime property with a sensible default (e.g., if a value is provided at runtime it will be used, otherwise the value specified here in this file will be used).

To run a specific test category we need to provide the value for it at runtime by specifying the groups runtime property (e.g., `-Dgroups=`).

Here are the available execution commands given our current category interfaces:

```
mvn clean test -Dgroups=tests.groups.Shallow
mvn clean test -Dgroups=tests.groups.Deep
mvn clean test -Dgroups=tests.groups.All
```

You can also specify multiple tags by separating them with a commma (without spaces).

```
mvn clean test -Dgroups=tests.groups.Shallow,tests.groups.Deep
```
