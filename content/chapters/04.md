# A Programming Primer

This section will prime you with just enough programming concepts (and how they pertain to Selenium) so you have some working knowledge and a vocabulary. This will help you more effectively comprehend what you will see throughout this book (and in your work afterwards).

Don't get too hung up on the details though. If something doesn't make sense it should once we dig into the full examples in the following chapters. Consider this more of a glossary than a code school.

## Programming Concepts In A Nutshell

Programming can be a deep and intimidating rabbit hole if you're new to it. But don't worry. When it comes to automated browser testing there is only a small subset of programming that we really need to know in order to get started. Granted, the more you know, the better off you'll be. But you don't need to know a whole lot in order to be effective right now.

Of all the programming concepts out there, here are the ones you'll need to pay attention right now:

+ Object Structures (Variables, Methods, and Classes)
+ Access Modifiers (public, protected, private, etc.)
+ Types of Objects (Strings, Integers, Booleans, etc.)
+ Actions (Assertions and Conditionals)
+ Attributes
+ Inheritance

Let's step through each and how they pertain to testing with Selenium.

### Object Structures

<u>Variables</u>

<u>Methods</u>

<u>Classes</u>

### Access Modifiers

### Types of Objects

### Actions

A benefit of booleans is that we can use them to perform an assertion.

<u>Assertions</u>

<u>Conditionals</u>

### Decorators

Decorators are a form of metadata. They are used by various libraries to enable additional functionality.

The most common use of decorators in our tests is when 

### Inheritance
