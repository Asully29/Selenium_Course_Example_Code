# A Programming Primer

This section will prime you with just enough programming concepts (and how they pertain to Selenium) so you have some working knowledge and a vocabulary. This will help you more effectively comprehend what you will see throughout this book (and in your work afterwards).

Don't get too hung up on the details though. If something doesn't make sense it should once we dig into the full examples in the following chapters. Consider this more of a glossary than a code school.

## Installation

Python has a quickly evolving ecosystem. In order to find the latest on how to install it, check out [the Downloading Python Guide at python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

## Installing Third-Party Libraries

There are over 84,000 third-party libraries (a.k.a. "packages") available for Python through PyPI (the Python Package Index). To install packages from it you use a program called [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/).

To install them you use `pip install package-name` from the command-line.

Here is a list of the packages that will be used throughout the book.

- [`pytest`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest/2.9.2)
- [`pytest-randomly`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-randomly/1.0.0)
- [`pytest-xdist`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist/1.14)
- [`selenium`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/2.53.6)

## Interactive Prompt

One of the immediate advantages to using a scripting language like Python is that you get access to an interactive prompt. Just type `python` from the command-line. It will load a prompt that looks like this:

```sh
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 14 2015, 19:46:27)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.39)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

In this prompt you can type out Python code. It will evaluate it and return the result. As you step through this chapter it will serve as a great place to practice the commands and concepts you will see.

When you're done, just type `quit()`.

## Choosing A Text Editor

In order to write Python code, you will need to use a text editor. Some popular ones are [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

There's also the option of going for an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

It's important to pick an editor that works for you and makes you productive. So if you're new to programming and text editors then it's probably best to go with something more intuitive like Sublime Text or PyCharm.

## Programming Concepts In A Nutshell

Programming can be a deep and intimidating rabbit hole if you're new to it. But don't worry. When it comes to automated browser testing there is only a small subset of programming that we really need to know in order to get started. Granted, the more you know, the better off you'll be. But you don't need to know a whole lot in order to be effective right now.

Of all the programming concepts out there, here are the ones you'll need to pay attention right now:

+ Object Structures (Variables, Methods, and Classes)
+ Scope
+ Types of Objects (Strings, Integers, Data Structures, Booleans, etc.)
+ Actions (Assertions and Conditionals)
+ Decorators
+ Inheritance

Let's step through each and how they pertain to testing with Selenium.

### Object Structures

<u>Variables</u>

Variables are places to store and retrieve values of various types (e.g., Strings, Integers, etc. -- more on these later). Variables are created and then referenced by their name.

A variable name:

+ can be one or more words in length
+ use an underbar (`_`) to separate the words (e.g., `example_variable`)
+ start with a lowercase letter
+ are often entirely lowercase
+ multiple word variables can be combined into a single word for better readability

You can store things in them by using an equals sign (`=`) after their name. In Python, a variable takes on the type of the value you store in it (more on object types later).

```sh
>>> example_variable = "42"
>>> print type(example_variable)
# outputs: <type 'str'>
# 'str' is short for "string"

>>> example_variable = 42
>>> print type(example_variable)
# outputs: <type 'int'>
# 'int' is short for "integer"
```

In the above example `print` is used to output a message. This is a common command that is useful for generating output to the terminal.

In Selenium, a common example of a variable is when we need to store an element (or the value from an element) in the beginning of a test to be referenced later. For example, getting a page's title.

```python
page_title = driver.title
```

`driver` is the variable we will use to interact with Selenium.

<u>Methods</u>

One way to group common actions (a.k.a. behavior) for easy reuse is to place them into methods. We define a method with the opening keyword `def`, a name (in the same fashion as a variable), and end the method with white-space. Referencing a method is done the same way as a variable -- by its name. And the lines of code within the method need to be indented.

```python
def example_method():
  # your code
  # goes here

example_method()
```

Additionally, we can specify arguments we want to pass into the method when calling it.

```sh
>>> def say(message):
...     print message
...
>>> say("Hello World!")
# outputs: Hello World!
```

When setting an argument, we can also set a default value to use if no argument is provided.

```sh
>>> def say(message = "Hello World!")
...     print message
...
>>> say()
# outputs: # Hello World!
>>> say("something else")
# outputs: something else
```

We'll see something like this used in Selenium when we are telling Selenium how to wait with explicit waits (more on that in Chapter 10).

<u>Classes</u>

Classes are a useful way to represent concepts that will be reused numerous times in multiple places. They can contain variables and methods and are defined with the word `class` followed by the name you wish to give it.

Class names:

+ start with a capital letter
+ should be PascalCase for multiple words (e.g., `class ExampleClass`)
+ should be descriptive (e.g., a noun, whereas methods should be a verb)
+ end with whitespace (just like methods)

You first have to define a class, and then create an instance of it (a.k.a. instantiation) in order to use it. Once you have an instance you can access the methods within it to trigger an action. Methods in classes need to use the keyword `self` as an argument in order to be properly referenced.

```python
>>> class Message():
...     def say(self, message = "Hello World!"):
...             print message
...
>>> message_instance = Message()
>>> message_instance.say("This is an instance of a class")
# outputs: This is an instance of a class
```

An example of this in Selenium is the representation of a web page -- also known as a 'Page Object'. In it you will store the page's elements and behavior we want to interact with.

```python
class LoginPage():
    _login_form = {"by": By.ID, "value": "login"}
    _username_input = {"by": By.ID, "value": "username"}
    _password_input = {"by": By.ID, "value": "password"}

    def with_(self, username, password):
# ...
```

The variables that start with underscores (e.g., `_`) are considered internal (or "local") variables, the values in curly brackets (`{}`) are called dictionaries. More on all of that soon.

## Scope

Now that we have our different object structures it's worth briefly covering how they can and cannot access one another. The easiest way to do this is by discussing the different types of variables you are likely to run into.

### Local Variables

Local variables enable you to store and retrieve values from within a confined area (this is no different than what was described in the variables section earlier). A variable that was declared within a method is a great example of this. It is useful within the method it was declared, but inaccessible outside of it.

### Instance Variables

Instance variables enable you to store and retrieve values more broadly (e.g., both inside and outside of methods). They are named the same way as regular variables, except that they start with `self.`. This is only applicable for variables within a class.

A common example you will see throughout this book is the usage of `self.driver`. This is an instance of Selenium stored in an instance variable. This object is what enables us to control the browser and by storing it as an instance variable we'll be able to use it where necessary.

__NOTE: There are also class variables, which are similar to instance variables in terms of their scope. They do not require `.self` as part of their declaration. We'll see these when we get into Page Objects in Chapter 8.__

## Private Objects

Python is a dynamic language with few constraints (which is very much the opposite of defensive compiled languages like Java). The idea of limited object access (either implied by an object's scope or explicitly by a `private` keyword like in other programming languages) isn't an enforcible concept in Python. But there is a saying in Python -- "We are all responsible users".

It means that rather than relying on hard constraints we should rely on [a set of conventions](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/). These conventions are meant to indicate which elements should and should not be accessed directly.

The convention for this is to start variable and method names which are meant to be private (e.g., only meant to be used internally where the object was declared) with an underscore. (e.g., `_example_variable` or `_example_method():`).

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are a way to pass information into our program from outside of it. They are also a way to make a value globally accessible (e.g., across an entire program, or set of programs). They can be set and retrieved from within your code by:

+ importing the built-in `os` Python library (e.g., `import os`)
+ using the `os.environ` lookup syntax
+ specify the environment variable name with it

Environment variables are often used to store configuration values that could change. A great example of this is the access key for a third-party service provider that we'll use in our tests.

```python
import os
_credentials = os.environ["SAUCE_USERNAME"] + ":" + os.environ["SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY"]
```

### Types of Objects

<u>Strings</u>

Strings are alpha-numeric characters packed together (e.g., letters, numbers, and most special characters) surrounded by either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

You'll run into Strings when working with copy on a page (e.g., pulling a page's URL, title, or h1 tag to determine if your test is in the right place before proceeding).

<u>Numbers</u>

The two common types of numbers you will run into with testing are Integers (whole numbers) and Float (decimals). Or `'int'` and `'float'` with regards to how the Python language refers to them.

If you have a test that needs to pull some values from a page and add/subtract/multiply/divide them, then this will come in handy. Although you may need to convert the values from a String to an Integer first. But don't sweat it, this is a trivial thing to do in Python.

```python
int("42")
```

The conversion from a `'str'` to an `'int'` is done with `int()` method. If you're working with decimals, you can use the `decimal` library built into Python to convert it.

```python
>>> import decimal
>>> decimal.Decimal("42.00")
```

<u>Data Structures</u>

Data Structures enable you to gather a set of data for later use. In Python there are numerous data structures. The one we'll want to pay attention to is Dictionaries.

Dictionaries are an unordered set of data stored in key/value pairs. The keys are unique and are used to look up the data in the dictionary.

```python
>>> a_dictionary = {"this": "that", "the": "other"}
>>> print a_dictionary["this"]
# outputs: that
>>> print a_dictionary["the"]
# outputs: other
```

You'll end up working with Dictionaries in your Page Objects to store and retrieve your page's locators.

```python
class LoginPage():
    _login_form = {"by": By.ID, "value": "login"}
    _username_input = {"by": By.ID, "value": "username"}
    _password_input = {"by": By.ID, "value": "password"}
    # ...
```

<u>Booleans</u>

Booleans are binary values that are returned when asking a question of your code. They are what enable us to complete assertions.

There are numerous ways to ask questions. Some involve various [comparison operators](https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions) (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=>`). The response is either `True` or `False`.

```python
>>> 2+2 == 4
True
```

Selenium also has commands that return a boolean result when we ask questions of the page we're testing.

```python
element.is_displayed()
# outputs: returns `True` if the element is on the page and visible
```

### Actions

A benefit of booleans is that we can use them to perform an assertion.

<u>Assertions</u>

Assertions are made against booleans and result in either a passing or failing test. In order to leverage assertions we will need to use a testing framework (e.g., [pytest](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html), or [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). For the examples in this book we will be using pytest (version 2.9.2).

pytest has a built-in assertion method which accepts an argument for something that returns a boolean.

```python
driver.get "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com"
assert(driver.title == "The Internet")

# or

driver.get "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com"
title_present = @driver.title == "The Internet"
assert(title_present)
```

Both approaches will work, resulting in a passing assertion. If this is the only assertion in your test then this will result in a passing test. More on this and other good test writing practices in Chapter 5.

<u>Conditionals</u>

Conditionals work with booleans as well. They enable you execute different code paths based on their values.

The most common conditionals in Python are `if`, `elif` (short for else/if), and `else` statements.

```python
number = 10
if number > 10:
  print "The number is greater than 10"
elif number < 10:
  print "The number is less than 10"
elif number == 10:
  print "The number is 10"
else:
  print "I don't know what the number is."
end

# outputs: The number is 10
```

You'll end up using conditionals in your test setup code to determine which browser to load based on a configuration value. Or whether or not to run your tests locally or somewhere else.

```python
    if config.host == "localhost":
        if config.browser == "firefox":
            driver_ = webdriver.Firefox()
        elif config.browser == "chrome":
            _chromedriver = os.getcwd() + "/vendor/chromedriver"
            driver_ = webdriver.Chrome(_chromedriver)
```

More on that in chapters 12 and 13.

### Decorators

Decorators are a form of metadata. They are used by various libraries to enable additional functionality in your tests.

The most common way we're going to use this is for our test setup and teardown. In pytest we do this with a fixture (which is a function that gets called before our test with the option to execute it after the test as well).

```python
    @pytest.fixture
    def driver(self, request):
        driver_ = webdriver.Firefox()

        def quit():
            driver_.quit()

        request.addfinalizer(quit)
        return driver_
```

The decorator with the `@` symbol, has a name to go along with it (e.g., `@pytest.fixture`), and is placed above the object that it effects (e.g., the `driver` method). We'll see decorators used for a few different things throughout the book.

### Inheritance

Classes have the ability to connect to one-another through parent/child inheritance. By having a single parent class we can store common actions in methods that can be readily available to all child classes.

Inheritance is done when declaring a child class by:

+ providing the class name
+ importing the parent class (when in another file)
+ specifying the parent class name as a declaration argument

```python
>>> class Parent():
...     hair_color = "brown"
...
>>> class Child(Parent):
...     pass
...
>>> c = Child()
>>> c.hair_color

# outputs: brown
```

You'll see this in your tests when writing all of the common Selenium actions you intend to use into methods in a parent class. Inheriting this class will allow you to call these methods in your child classes (more on this in Chapter 9).
