# Waiting

## Implicit Wait

+ Specify a timeout in milliseconds (typically during _test setup_)
+ For every command that Selenium is unable to complete, it will retry it until either:
  + the action can be accomplished, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception (typically `NoSuchElementError`)
+ Less flexible than explicit waits
+ Not recommended

```ruby
driver.manage.timeouts.implicit_wait = 5
```

## Explicit Waits

+ Specify a timeout (in milliseconds) and an expected condition to wait for
+ Selenium will check for the expected condition repeatedly until either:
  + is is successful, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception
+ Recommended way to wait in your tests

```ruby
wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: seconds)
wait.until { driver.find_element(locator).displayed? }
```
