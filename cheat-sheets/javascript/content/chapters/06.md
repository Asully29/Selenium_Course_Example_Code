# Waiting

## Implicit Wait

+ Specify a timeout during _test setup_ (in milliseconds)
+ For every command that Selenium is unable to complete, it will retry it until either:
  + the action can be accomplished, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception (typically `NoSuchElementError`)
+ Less flexible than explicit waits
+ Not recommended

```javascript
driver.manage().setTimeouts({ implicit: 15000 });
```

## Explicit Waits

+ Specify a timeout (in milliseconds) and an expected condition to wait for
+ Selenium will check for the expected condition repeatedly until either:
  + is is successful, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception
+ Recommended way to wait in your tests

```javascript
const { Until } = require('selenium-webdriver');
await this.driver.wait(Until.elementLocated(locator), timeout)
```
