# Waiting

## Implicit Wait

+ Specify a timeout in seconds (typically during _test setup_)
+ For every command that Selenium is unable to complete, it will retry it until either:
  + the action can be accomplished, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception (typically `NoSuchElementException`)
+ Less flexible than explicit waits
+ Not recommended

```python
driver.implicitly_wait(15)
```

## Explicit Waits

+ Specify a timeout (in seconds) and an expected condition to wait for
+ Selenium will check for the expected condition repeatedly until either:
  + is is successful, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception
+ Recommended way to wait in your tests

```python
wait = WebDriverWait(self.driver, timeout)
wait.until(
    expected_conditions.visibility_of_element_located(
      (locator['by'], locator['value'])))
```
