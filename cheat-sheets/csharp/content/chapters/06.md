# Waiting

## Implicit Wait

+ Specify a timeout in milliseconds (typically during _test setup_)
+ For every command that Selenium is unable to complete, it will retry it until either:
  + the action can be accomplished, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception (typically `NoSuchElementError`)
+ Less flexible than explicit waits
+ Not recommended

```csharp
Driver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitlyWait(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
```

## Explicit Waits

+ Specify a timeout (in milliseconds) and an expected condition to wait for
+ Selenium will check for the expected condition repeatedly until either:
  + is is successful, or
  + the amount of time specified has been reached and raise an exception
+ Recommended way to wait in your tests

```csharp
WebDriverWait Wait = new WebDriverWait(Driver, System.TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
Wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(locator));
return true;
```
