The Selenium Guidebook Team License
======================================

Thank you for purchasing a team license for The Selenium Guidebook!
This allows you to share the content with up to 5 team members.

The content is defined as the PDF, HTML, Mobi, and ePub documents as well
as the source code for all of the code examples contained in code_examples.zip

A team member is defined as someone with whom you do a substantial amount
of testing and development work and/or who is employed by the same company
as you.

Essentially, I would appreaciate it if you didn't share any of the content
publically, be it on code sharing sites like Github or torrent sites or
what have you.
