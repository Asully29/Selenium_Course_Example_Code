# Acknowledgements

Revisiting this edition after having completed editions for all of the officially supported programming languages is a special treat. It reminds of a time when I had just the Ruby edition of my book and I was hesitant to embark upon another programming language (let alone several). Ravi Gupta gave me the initial nudge, and I haven't looked back since. Thanks again Ravi, I still hope this was what you were looking for.

Also a huge thanks to Ravi, Jonathan Taylor, Matthew Edwards, Josh Grant, and Brian Goad for offering to review my initial code in previous editions, as well as providing constructive feedback, and acting as a general sounding board. No matter the amount of effort you provided (big or small) this book continues to get better as a result of your initial help with the ground work. Thank you!

I'd also like to thank the following readers (sorted alphabetically by last name):

- Matt Allen
- Benjamin Limb
- Myroslav Oleinykov
- Mark Winspear

Matt, Benjamin, Myroslav, and Mark -- your feedback is still in place and continues to make the book into something much more clear and concise than it was before. I'm thrilled that you got so much out of reading it and provided so much great feedback in return.

And lastly I'd like to thank you, the reader. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have started writing about Selenium years ago -- let alone consider porting my book into other programming languages. Thanks for reading! I hope you find it useful in your daily work.


Cheers,  
Dave H
