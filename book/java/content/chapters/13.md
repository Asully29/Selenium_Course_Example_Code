# Running Browsers In The Cloud

If you've ever needed to test features in an older browser like Internet Explorer 8 then odds are you ran a virtual machine (VM) on your computer with a "legit" version of Windows XP.

Handy, but what happens when you need to check things on multiple versions of IE? Now you're looking at multiple VMs. And what about when you need to scale and cover other browser and Operating System (OS) combinations? Now you're looking at provisioning, running, and maintaining your own set of machines and standing up something like Selenium Grid to coordinate tests across them.

Rather than take on the overhead of a test infrastructure you can easily outsource this to a third-party cloud provider like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

## A Selenium Remote, Selenium Grid, And Sauce Labs Primer

At the heart of Selenium at scale is the use of Selenium Grid and Selenium Remote.

Selenium Grid lets you distribute test execution across several machines and you connect to it with Selenium Remote. You tell the Grid which browser and OS you want your test to run on through the use of Selenium Remote's `DesiredCapabilities`.

Under the hood this is how Sauce Labs works. They are ultimately running Selenium Grid behind the scenes, and they receive and execute tests through Selenium Remote and the `DesiredCapabilities` you set.

Let's dig in with an example.

## An Example

### Part 1: Initial Setup

__NOTE: You'll need an account to use Sauce Labs. Their [free trial](https://saucelabs.com/signup/trial) offers enough to get you started. And if you're signing up because you want to test an open source project, then be sure to check out their [Open Sauce account](https://saucelabs.com/open-source).__

With Sauce Labs we need to provide specifics about what we want in our test environment, our credentials, and configure Selenium a little bit differently than we have been. Let's start by updating our `Config` class to include the variables we'll need to specify.

```java
// filename: tests/Config.java
package tests;

public class Config {
    public static final String baseUrl        = System.getProperty("baseUrl", "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");
    public static final String browser        = System.getProperty("browser", "firefox");
    public static final String host           = System.getProperty("host", "localhost");
    public static final String browserVersion = System.getProperty("browserVersion", "50");
    public static final String platform       = System.getProperty("platform", "Windows 10");
    public static final String sauceUser      = System.getenv("SAUCE_USERNAME");
    public static final String sauceKey       = System.getenv("SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY");
}
```

In addition to the `baseUrl` and `browser` variables, we've added several other (e.g., `host`, `browserVersion`, `platform`, `sauceUser`, and `sauceKey`).

`host` enables us to specify whether our tests run locally or on Sauce Labs. If we don't specify a value at runtime, then the tests will execute locally.

With `browser`, `browserVeresion`, and `platform` we can specify which browser and operating system combination we want our tests to run on. You can see a full list of Sauce's available platform options [here](https://saucelabs.com/platforms/). They also have a handy configuration generator (which will tell you what values to plug into your test) [here](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/platforms-configurator/). We've made so if no values are provided at run time, they will default to `firefox` version `50` running on `Windows 10`.

`sauceUser` is your Sauce username, and `sauceKey` is your Sauce Access Key (which can be found on [your account dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/account)). An alternative to hard-coding your credentials is to store them in environment variables and retrieve them.

```java
public static final String sauceUser      = System.getenv("SAUCE_USERNAME");
public static final String sauceKey       = System.getenv("SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY");
```

Do whichever you're more comfortable and familiar with.

Now we can update our base test class to work with Selenium Remote.

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java
// ...
        @Override
        protected void before() throws Throwable {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browser);
                capabilities.setCapability("version", browserVersion);
                capabilities.setCapability("platform", platform);
                String sauceUrl = String.format("http://%s:%s@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub",
                        sauceUser, sauceKey);
                driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(sauceUrl), capabilities);
            } else if (host.equals("localhost")) {
                if (browser.equals("firefox")) {
                    System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver",
                            System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/vendor/geckodriver");
                    driver = new FirefoxDriver();
                } else if (browser.equals("chrome")) {
                    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver",
                            System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/vendor/chromedriver");
                    driver = new ChromeDriver();
                }
            }
        }
// ...
```

In our `before` method we've added a new conditional flow (e.g., `if`/`else if`) to check the `host` variable.

We start by checking to see if it's set to `"saucelabs"`. If it is we create a `DesiredCapabilities` object, populate it (with `browser`, `browserVersion`, and `platform` values), and connect to Sauce Labs using Selenium Remote (passing in the `DesiredCapabilities` object). This will return a Selenium WebDriver object that we can use just like when running our tests locally.

If the `host` variable is set to `"localhost"` then our tests will run locally just like before.

If we save everything and run our tests in Sauce Labs (e.g., `mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs`) then on the account dashboard we'll see our tests running in Firefox 50 on Windows 10.

And if we wanted to run our tests on different browser and operating system combinations, here are what some of the commands would look like:

```
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser="internet explorer" -DbrowserVersion=8
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser="internet explorer" -DbrowserVersion=10 -Dplatform="Windows 8.1"
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser=firefox -DbrowserVersion=26 -Dplatform="Windows 7"
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser=safari -DbrowserVersion=8 -Dplatform="OS X 10.10"
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser=chrome -DbrowserVersion=40 -Dplatform="OS X 10.8"
```

Notice the properties with quotations (e.g., `"internet explorer"` and `"OS X 10.10"`). When dealing with more than one word in a runtime property we need to make sure to surround them in double-quotes (or else our test code won't compile).

### Part 2: Test Name

It's great that our tests are running on Sauce Labs. But we're not done yet because the test name in each Sauce job is getting set to `unnamed job`. This makes it extremely challenging to know what test was run in the job. To remedy this we'll need to pass in the test name in `DesiredCapabilities`.

To grab the name from each test we'll use another one of JUnit's rules in the base test class -- a [TestWatcher Rule](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Rules#testwatchmantestwatcher-rules).

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java
// ...
    protected WebDriver driver;
    private String testName;
// ...
    @Rule
    public TestRule watcher = new TestWatcher() {
        @Override
        protected void starting(Description description) {
            testName = description.getDisplayName();
        }
    };

}
```

After creating a variable to store the test name in, we add the `TestWatcher` rule. It has a method called `starting` that gives us access to the description of each test as its starting. So we grab the display name for the test and store it in the `testName` field variable.

Now we can add it to our `DesiredCapabilities`.

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java
// ...
        @Override
        protected void before() throws Throwable {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browser);
                capabilities.setCapability("version", browserVersion);
                capabilities.setCapability("platform", platform);
                capabilities.setCapability("name", testName);
// ...
```

Now when we run our tests in Sauce Labs (e.g., `mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs` from the command-line), [the account dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/account) will show the tests running with a correct name.

### Part 3: Test Status

There's still one more thing we'll need to handle, and that's setting the status of the Sauce Labs job after it completes.

Right now regardless of the outcome of a test, the job in Sauce Labs will register as `Finished`. Ideally we want to know if the job was a `Pass` or a `Fail`. That way we can tell at a glance if a test failed or not. And with a couple of tweaks to our test code, along with the help of [the `saucerest` library](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucerest-java), we can make this change easily enough.

We'll first need install the `saucerest` library by adding it to our `pom.xml` file.

```java
// filename: pom.xml
// ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.saucelabs</groupId>
            <artifactId>saucerest</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.35</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

    </dependencies>
// ...
```

In addition to the dependency values we have to add the repository information of where to download the library from.

Next we need to update our base test class to use this library for each successful and failed test.

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java

package tests;
// ...
import com.saucelabs.saucerest.SauceREST;

public class Base {

    protected WebDriver driver;
    private String testName;
    private String sessionId;
    private SauceREST sauceClient;
// ...
        @Override
        protected void before() throws Throwable {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browser);
                capabilities.setCapability("version", browserVersion);
                capabilities.setCapability("platform", platform);
                capabilities.setCapability("name", testName);
                String sauceUrl = String.format("http://%s:%s@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub",
                        sauceUser, sauceKey);
                driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(sauceUrl), capabilities);
                sessionId = ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).getSessionId().toString();
                sauceClient = new SauceREST(sauceUser, sauceKey);
// ...
```

After importing the `saucerest` library we create two new field variables. One to store the session ID of the test run (e.g., `private String sessionId`) and the other to store the `saucerest` client session (e.g., `private SauceREST sauceClient`).

Once a Sauce job is established we're able to get the seession ID from `RemoteWebDriver` and store it's string value in `sessionId`. We then create an instance of `SauceREST` (which connects to the Sauce API) and store the session in `sauceClient`.

Now to expand our `TestWatcher` rule to use these variables when a test fails or succeeds.

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java
// ...
    @Rule
    public TestRule watcher = new TestWatcher() {

        @Override
        protected void starting(Description description) {
            testName = description.getDisplayName();
        }

        @Override
        protected void failed(Throwable throwable, Description description) {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                sauceClient.jobFailed(sessionId);
                System.out.println(String.format("https://saucelabs.com/tests/%s", sessionId));
            }
        }

        @Override
        protected void succeeded(Description description) {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                sauceClient.jobPassed(sessionId);
            }
        }

    };

}
```

In addition to the `starting` method offered by the `TestWatcher` rule there are `failed` and `succeeded` methods. Either one will execute after a test depending on its outcome.

With a conditional check in each we make sure the `sauceClient` commands only trigger only when a Sauce session has been established.

When a test is successful the `succeeded` method will fire, marking the Sauce job for the test as passed. When a test fails the `failed` method will trigger, and the Sauce job will get update as failed. Additionally, when there's a failure we'll want to know the URL for the job, so we concatenate the URL and output it to the console using the `System.out.println` command.

Now when we run our tests in Sauce (`mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs`) and navigate to [the Sauce Labs Account page](https://saucelabs.com/account), we will see our tests running like before -- but now there will be a proper test status when they finish (e.g., `Pass` or `Fail`). And if there's a failure, we'll see the URL for the job in the failure output locally.

### Part 4: Sauce Connect

There are various ways that companies make their pre-production application available for testing. Some use an obscure public URL and protect it with some form of authentication (e.g., Basic Auth, or cert based authentication). Others keep it behind their firewall. For those that stay behind a firewall, Sauce Labs has you covered.

They have a program called [Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/) that creates a secure tunnel between your machine and their cloud. With it, you can run tests in Sauce Labs and test applications that are only available on your private network.

To use Sauce Connect, you need to download and run it. There's a copy for each operating system -- get yours [here](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/#basic-setup) and run it from the command-line. In the context of our existing test code let's download Sauce Connect, unzip it's contents, and store it in a sub-folder in the `vendor` directory.

```text

        │   ├── libsauceconnect.a
        │   └── libsauceconnect.la
        └── license.html
```

Now we just need to launch the application while specifying our Sauce account credentials.

```

Now that the tunnel is established, we could run our tests against a local instance of our application (e.g., [the-internet](https://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet)). Assuming the application was set up and running on our local machine, we could run `mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -DbaseUrl=http://localhost:4567` from the command-line and it would work.

To see the status of the tunnel, we can view it on [the tunnel page of the account dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/tunnels). To shut the tunnel down, we can do it manually from this page. Or we can issue a `Ctrl+C` command to the terminal window where its running.

When the tunnel is closing, here's what you'll see.

```
