The Selenium Guidebook Team License
======================================

Thank you for purchasing a team license for The Selenium Guidebook!
This allows you to share the content with up to 10 team members.

The content is defined as the PDF, MOBI, and EPUB documents as well
as the source code for all of the code examples contained accompanying zip file.

A team member is defined as someone with whom you do a substantial amount
of testing and development work and/or who is employed by the same company
as you.

Essentially, I would appreaciate it if you didn't share any of the content
publically, be it on code sharing sites like Github or torrent sites or
what have you.
