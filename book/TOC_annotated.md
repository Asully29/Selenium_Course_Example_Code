## Chapters

### Part 1 -- First Principles
#### 1.  What Selenium Is, Is Not, and How It Works
#### 2.  What Makes a Good Acceptance Test
#### 3.  All The Programming You Need To Know

### Part 2 -- Strategy
#### 4.  Defining a Test Strategy
#### 5.  Picking a Language
#### ?.  Communication/Culture/Context

### Part 3 -- Tactics
#### 6.  Writing Tests -- An effective Locator Strategy
- quality indicator for your selectors (e.g. core to app vs brittle/changing copy & selectors)
-- 'identifying effective locators'
#### 7.  Writing Re-usable Test Code -- Page Objects, Page Widgets, and a Facade Layer
#### 8.  Writing Resilient Test Code -- Waiting
#### 9.  Working With Mobile
#### ?.  Debugging Your Tests
- getting the right selectors
- go through the feedback loop of seeing what Selenium is doing (and figuring out how to modify it what it wants)
- "seeing what you have and what you can do"
- slow test or a broken wait
#### 10. Things You will See And How To Work With Them -- Dynamic Pages, Uploads & Downloads, Tables, Frames, Multiple Windows, Dropdown Lists (Forms?), A/B Testing

### Part 4 -- Implementation
#### 11. Packaging For Use
#### 12. Tagging
#### 13. Reporting (e.g. Sauce)
#### 14. Building a Feedback Loop with Continuous Integration
- Primer (its not free)
- Gated Test Packs
- Jenkins & Travis
- Full Team Buy-in of the tests you are running in CI (failure implies immediate team action)
-- what actions need to be taken based on outcome
-- e.g. smoke is immediate, regression is filing a bug
#### 15. Scaling Your Test Infrastructure (e.g. Sauce)
- link to other resources for Grid (e.g. when you're in the situation where you can't use Sauce)
- get a prototype running in Sauce, then if you have to replicate internally, you know what you need to replicate
#### 16. Speeding Up Test Runs with Parallelization

### Part 5 -- Citizenship
#### 17. Available Resources (e.g. Documentation, Books, Blogs, Events, Google Groups, IRC, etc.)
#### 18. Communicating with the Selenium Community (Selenium IRC Chat)
#### 19. Getting Involved (e.g. Contribute to code/documentation, give a talk, start a meetup, etc.)
