# 1.1.0 - July 31, 2014

+ Errata fixes throughout the book (both grammar and code fixes) primarily from reader feedback
+ Updated Acknowledgements to thank my awesome readers for contributing spot on feedback
+ Beefed up Chapter 11 with more examples and descriptions for clarity
+ Added a code fix for the Sauce Connect tunnel configuration
+ Tested the code examples against a Ruby 2.1.x version
+ Set the RSpec version to 2.14 (since version 3 has breaking changes which will be addressed in a future version of the book)
+ Removed the Mobile Testing Chapter (17.9) since there is now a dedicated getting started guide for Appium
+ Added new content to the second half of the book for checkboxes, drag and drop, forgot password, and Selenium Grid
