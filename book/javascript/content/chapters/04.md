# A Programming Primer

This section will prime you with just enough programming concepts (and how they pertain to Selenium) so you have some working knowledge and a vocabulary. This will help you more effectively comprehend what you will see throughout this book (and in your work afterwards).

Don't get too hung up on the details though. If something doesn't make sense it should once we dig into the full examples in the following chapters. Consider this more of a glossary than a code school.

## Installation

Installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is pretty straight-forward. There are installer packages available for Mac and Windows operating systems on [the Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). There are also binary distributions avaialble for various Linux distros ([link](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)).

If you're running on a Mac and you want to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), then be sure to check out [this write-up from Treehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac).

## Installing Third-Party Libraries

There are over 1 million third-party libraries (a.k.a. "packages") available for Node.js through [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm). `npm` is the Node Package Manager program that comes bundled with Node.

You can search for packages from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/). You don't need an account. Simply type into the search field at the top of the page and press Enter.

To install packages with it you type `npm install package-name` from the command-line. You can install a package globally using the `-g` flag. You can also auto-save the package to a local file (e.g., `package.json`) which explicitly states the package name and version you are using with the `--save` flag.

Here is a list of the packages we will be working with in this book:

- [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver)
- [geckodriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geckodriver)
- [chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver)
- [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)
- [mocha-parallel-tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-parallel-tests)

## Interactive Prompt

Node.js comes with an interactive prompt (a.k.a. a [REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) (record-eval-print loop)).

Just type `node` from the command-line. It will load a simple prompt that looks like this:

```text
>
```

In this prompt you can type out Node.js code. It will evaluate it and return the result. As you step through this chapter it will serve as a great place to practice the commands and concepts you will see.

When you're done, just type `.exit`.

## Choosing A Text Editor

In order to write Node.js code, you will need to use a text editor. Some popular ones are [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom), [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

There's also the option of going for an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (it's not free, but has a free 30-day trial) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

It's important to pick an editor that works for you and makes you productive. So if you're new to programming and text editors then it's probably best to go with something more intuitive like Sublime Text, or WebStorm. If you end up using WebStorm be sure to check out the documentation on using it with Mocha ([link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/running-unit-tests-on-mocha.html)).

## Programming Concepts In A Nutshell

Programming can be a deep and intimidating rabbit hole if you're new to it. But don't worry. When it comes to automated browser testing there is only a small subset of programming that we really need to know in order to get started. Granted, the more you know, the better off you'll be. But you don't need to know a whole lot in order to be effective right now.

Of all the programming concepts out there, here are the ones you'll need to pay attention right now:

+ Object Structures (Variables, Functions, Methods, and Classes)
+ Scope
+ Object Types (Strings, Integers, Collections, Booleans, etc.)
+ Actions (Assertions and Conditionals)
+ Promises

Let's step through each and how they pertain to testing with Selenium.

### Object Structures

<u>Variables</u>

Variables are places to store and retrieve values of various types (e.g., Strings, Integers, etc. -- more on these later). Variables are created and then referenced by their name.

A variable name:

+ is prepended with the word `let`, or `const`
+ can be one or more words in length
+ starts with a letter
+ is not case sensitive
+ should not be a keyword or reserved word in JavaScript

Since variable names are not case sensitive there are various ways you can write them (e.g., `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `snake_case`, `kebab-case`). The general guidance across various style guides is to use `camelCase`.

You can store things in variables by using an equals sign (`=`) after their name. In Node.js, a variable takes on the type of the value you store in it (more on object types later).

```text
> let exampleVariable = "42";
> typeof(exampleVariable)
// outputs: 'string'

> exampleVariable = 42;
> typeof(exampleVariable);
// outputs: 'number'
```

__NOTE: `let` is used to declare a variable that can change, whereas `const` (short for "constant") is used to declare a variable that will not change.__

In Selenium, a common example of a variable is when we need to store an element (or the value from an element) in the beginning of a test to be referenced later. For example, getting a page's title.

```javascript
const pageTitle = driver.getTitle();
```

__NOTE: `driver` is the variable we will use to interact with Selenium throughout the book. More on that later.__

<u>Functions</u>

Functions are a way to group behavior together for easy reuse.

They can be specified and called on their own (e.g., they don't need to be part of a class -- more on classes soon).

When it comes to naming, they follow the same rules as variables. However, function names tend to be a verb (since they denote some kind of an action to be performed), and the contents of them are wrapped in opening and closing brackets (e.g., `{}`).

Functions can start either with the `function` keyword, or as an anonymous function (e.g., `() => { }`).

```javascript
function doSomething() {
  // your code
  // goes here
};

doSomething();
```

We can specify arguments we want to pass into a function when calling it.

Here's an example.

```text
> function say(message) {
... console.log(message);
... };
> say('Hello World!');
// outputs: Hello World!
```

We can also specify a default value to use if no argument is provided.

```text
> function say(message = 'Hello World!') {
... console.log(message);
... };
> say();
// outputs: Hello World!
> say('something else');
// outputs: something else
```

We'll see functions used occasionally throughout the book. Most notably in the setup and teardown for the tests.

```javascript
afterEach(async function() {
  const testPassed = this.currentTest.state === 'passed'
  await driverFactory.quit(testPassed)
})
```

<u>Methods</u>

Methods are functions that exist as part of an object (e.g., a class).

They can be specified as part of a class, don't require any special keywords, and follow the same naming conventions as functions.

<u>Classes</u>

Classes are a useful way to represent a concept that will be used more than once. They can contain variables and methods. They are useful when there is some underlying data (or state) that can change that you need to keep track of. 

Class names:

+ Starts with the `class` keyword followed by the name you want
+ the name needs to start with a capital letter
+ should be PascalCase for multiple words (e.g., `ExampleClass`)
+ should be descriptive (e.g., a noun, whereas functions would be a verb)

You first have to define the class. Then you specify variables and methods for it. Once defined, you need to create an instance of it (a.k.a. instantiation). Once you have an instance of it you can access the methods within it to trigger the behavior in them.

```text
> class Messenger {
...say(message){
...console.log(message);
...}
... }
> const messenger = new Messenger();
> messenger.say('This is an instance of a class');
// outputs: This is an instance of a class
```

An example of a class we'll see later in the book is storing information for how to interact with a web page -- also known as a page object. In it we'll store the locators for elements on the page we want to interact with in variables, and the behavior we intend to use on those variables in methods.

```javascript
const LOGIN_FORM = {id: "login"};
const USERNAME_INPUT = {id: "username"};
const PASSWORD_INPUT = {id: "password"};

class Login {
  authenticate(username, password) {
// ...
}
```

## Scope

Now that we have our different object structures it's worth briefly covering how they can and cannot access one another. The easiest way to do this is by discussing the different types of variables you are likely to run into.

### Local Variables

Local variables enable you to store and retrieve values from within a confined area (this is no different than what was described in the variables section earlier). A variable that was declared within a function or a method is a classic example of this. It is useful within the area it was declared, but inaccessible outside of it.

### Class Variables

Variables declared as a class property will enable you to store and retrieve them through the entire class (e.g., in all of its methods).

A common example you will see throughout the book is the usage of locators in page objects. These variables represent pieces of a web page we want to interact with. By storing them as broadly scoped variables we will be able to use them throughout an entire page object (e.g., class).

### Constants

Variables that are fully capitalized and separated by underscores (e.g., `_` if more than one word) are called constants. They are variables that won't change. They are commonly used to locator variables within page objects.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are a way to pass information into our test code from outside of it at run-time. They are also another way to make a value globally accessible (e.g., across an entire program, or set of programs). They can be set and retrieved from within your code by:

+ using the `process.env` lookup function
+ specifying the environment variable name with it

Environment variables are often used to retrieve configuration values that could change when running your tests. A great example of this is which browser to run the tests against.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  browser: process.env.BROWSER || 'firefox'
};
```

### Types of Objects

<u>Strings</u>

Strings are alpha-numeric characters (e.g., letters, numbers, and most special characters) surrounded by either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

You'll run into Strings when working with copy on a page (e.g., pulling a page's URL, title, or h1 tag to determine if your test is in the right place before proceeding).

<u>Numbers</u>

If you have a test that needs to pull some values from a page and add/subtract/multiply/divide them, then this will come in handy. Although you may need to convert the values from a String to an Number first. But don't sweat it, this is a trivial thing to do in JavaScript.

```javascript
Number("42")
// outputs: 42
```

<u>Collections</u>

Collections enable you to gather a set of data for later use. In JavaScript there are two common collection types -- arrays and objects. The one we'll want to pay attention to is objects.

Objects are an unordered set of data stored in key/value pairs. The keys are unique and are used to look up data in the object.

```text
> const example = {tomato: 'tomahto', potato: 'potahto'}
> example.tomato
// outputs: 'tomahto'
> example.potato
// outputs: 'potahto'
```

You'll end up working with objects in page objects to store and retrieve a page's locators.

```javascript
var LOGIN_FORM = {id: 'login'};
var USERNAME_INPUT = {id: 'username'};
var PASSWORD_INPUT = {id: 'password'};
var SUBMIT_BUTTON = {css: 'button'};
```

<u>Booleans</u>

Booleans are `true` or `false` values that get returned when asking a question of your code. They are what enable us to complete assertions.

There are numerous ways to ask these questions. Some involve various [comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators) (e.g., `==`, `===`, `!=`, `<`, `>`). The response of which is `true` or `false`.

```text
> 2+2 === 4
// outputs: true
```

Selenium also has commands that return a boolean result when we ask questions of the page we're testing.

```javascript
element.isDisplayed();
// returns true if the element is on the page and visible
```

### Actions

<u>Assertions</u>

With booleans we can perform assertions.

An assertion is used to check the that the actual result of something matches what you expected. This will result in either a passing or a failing test.

To leverage assertions we will need to use an assertion library (e.g., [the one built into Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/all.html#assert_assert) or any of [the assertion libraries Mocha supports](http://mochajs.org/#assertions)). For the examples in this book we will be using the assertion library that comes with Node.js.

```text
> const assert = require('assert');
> assert.equal(2+2, 5, 'incorrect')
// outputs: AssertionError: incorrect
```

<u>Conditionals</u>

Conditionals work with booleans as well. They enable you to execute different code paths based on their values.

The most common conditionals in JavaScript are `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

```javascript
const number = 10;
if (number > 10) {
  console.log('The number is greater than 10');
} else if (number < 10) {
  console.log('The number is less than 10');
} else if (number === 10) {
  consle.log('The number is 10');
} else {
  console.log('I don't know what the number is.');
}
// outputs: The number is 10
```

You'll end up using conditionals in your test setup code to determine which browser to load based on a configuration value. Or whether or not to run your tests locally or somewhere else.

```javascript
  } else if (config.host === 'localhost') {
    builder = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser(config.browser);
  // ...
```

More on that in chapters 13 and 14.

### Promises

Test execution with Selenium is a fundamentally synchronous activity (e.g., visiting a page, typing text input a field, submitting the form, and waiting for the response). But JavaScript execution is inherently asynchronous, meaning that it will not wait for a command to finish executing before proceeding onto the next one.

To account for this we enlist the help of a Promise.

Promises can take an asyncronous command and make our test code wait for it to complete. Thankfully, built into the Node.js there is now syntactic sugar to make working with promises very straigtforward. Through the user of the `async` and `await` keywords, we get all the benefit of promises with very little effort.

We'll see these keywords often in our Selenium test code, as they are fundamental to most of the commands we'll be using on a regular basis.

```javascript
async authenticate(username, password) {
  await driver.findElement({id: 'username'}).sendKeys('tomssmith');
// ...
}
```
