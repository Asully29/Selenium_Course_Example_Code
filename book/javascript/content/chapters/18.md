# Finding Information On Your Own

There is information all around us when it comes to Selenium. But it it can be challenging to sift through it, or know where to look.

Here is a list breaking down a majority of the Selenium resources available, and what they're useful for.

## Documentation & Tips

+ [Selenium HQ](http://bit.ly/se-info-1)

This is the official Selenium project documentation site. It's a bit dated, but there is loads of helpful information here. You just have to get the hang of how the navigate site to find what you need.

+ [The Selenium Wiki](http://bit.ly/se-info-29)

This is where all the good stuff is -- mainly, documentation about the various language bindings and browser drivers. If you're not already familiar with it, take a look.

+ [Elemental Selenium Archives](http://bit.ly/se-info-3)

Every tip I've written is freely available on the tips archive page. There are over 70 different Selenium problems and solutions covered. They're in Ruby, but the code has been open-sourced with a fair number of them being converted into other officially supported language bindings. You can find the code for them [here](https://github.com/tourdedave/elemental-selenium-tips).

## Blogs

+ [The official Selenium blog](http://bit.ly/se-info-4)

This is where news of the Selenium project gets announced, and there's also the occasional round-up of what's going on in the tech space (as it relates to testing). Definitely worth a look.

+ [A list of "all" Selenium WebDriver blogs](http://bit.ly/se-info-5)

At some point, someone rounded up a large list of blogs from Selenium practitioners and committers. It's a pretty good list.

## Other Books

+ [Selenium Testing Tools Cookbook](http://bit.ly/se-info-18)

This book outlines some great ways to leverage Selenium. It's clear that Gundecha has a very pragmatic approach that will yield great results.

+ [Selenium Design Patterns and Best Practices](http://bit.ly/se-info-21)

Dima Kovalenko's book covers useful tactics and strategies for successful test automation with Selenium. I was a technical reviewer for the book and think it's a tremendous resource. The book covers Ruby, but he has ported the examples to Java. You can find them [here](https://github.com/dimacus/SeleniumBestPracticesBook).

## Meetups

+ [All Selenium Meetups listed on Meetup.com](http://bit.ly/se-info-13)

A listing of all in-person Selenium Meetups are available on Meetup.com. If you're near a major city, odds are there's one waiting for you.

+ [How to start your own Selenium Meetup](https://saucelabs.com/blog/so-you-want-to-start-a-selenium-meetup-group-now-what)

If there's not a Selenium Meetup near you, start one! Sauce Labs has a great write up on how to do it.

## Conferences

+ [Selenium Conf](http://seleniumconf.com/)

This is the official conference of the Selenium project where practitioners and committers gather and share their latest knowledge and experiences with testing. There are two conferences a year, with the location changing every time (e.g., it's been in San Francisco, London, Boston, Bangalore, Portland, Austin, Berlin, Chicago, and Tokyo).

+ [Selenium Camp](http://seleniumcamp.com/)

This is an annual Selenium conference in Eastern Europe (in Kiev, Ukraine) organized by the folks at [XP Injection](http://xpinjection.com/). It's a terrific conference. If you can make the trip, I highly recommend it.

+ [List of other testing conferences](http://testingconferences.org/)

A helpful website that lists all of the testing conferences out there.

## Videos

+ [Selenium Conference Talks](http://bit.ly/se-info-15)

All of the talks from The Selenium Conference are recorded and made freely available online. This is a tremendous resource.

+ [Selenium Meetup Talks](http://bit.ly/se-info-16)

Some of the Selenium Meetups make it a point to record their talks and publish them afterwards. Here are some of them. They are a great way to see what other people are doing and pick up some new tips.

## Mailing Lists

+ [Selenium Developers List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-developers)

This is where developers discuss changes to the Selenium project, both technically and administratively.

+ [Selenium Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/selenium-users)
+ [Selenium LinkedIn Users Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/961927/)
The signal to noise ratio in these groups can be challenging at times. But you can occasionally find some answers to your questions.

## Forums

+ [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)
+ [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Selenium-testing-framework)
+ [Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/selenium)

These are the usual forums where you can go looking for answers to questions you're facing (in addition to the mailing lists above).

## Issues

+ [Selenium Issue Tracker](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues)

If you're running into a specific and repeatable issue that just doesn't make sense, you may have found a bug in Selenium. You'll want to check the Selenium Issue Tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, then create a new issue, assuming you're able to provide a short, self-contained, example to reproduce the problem.

This is known as [SSCCE](http://sscce.org) (a Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example). For a tongue-in-cheek take on providing isues with a reproducer, see [this post](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html).

## Chatting With the Selenium Community

The Selenium Chat Channel is arguably the best way to connect with the Selenium community and get questions answered. This is where committers and practitioners hang out day-in and day-out.

You can connect either through Slack or IRC. Details on how to connect are available [here](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/20-irc-chat).

Once connected, feel free to say hello and introduce yourself. But more importantly, ask your question. If it looks like no one is chatting, ask it anyway. Someone will see it and eventually respond. They always do. In order to get your answer, you'll probably need to hang around for a bit. But the benefit of being a fly on the wall is that you gain insight into other problems people face, possible solutions, and the current state of the Selenium project and its various pieces.
