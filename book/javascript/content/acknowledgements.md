So, JavaScript...

It's a language that I've finally warmed to thanks to my work with [Selenium IDE](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/).

When I wrote the last edition, I thought I had a decent handle on the language. But I realize now that there was a lot of opportunity for improvement. Partly because of the changes in the language (e.g., ES6 and the introduction of `async`/`await`) and partly because of what I've learned over the last year working full-time in the language.

As a result, there have been substantial changes to the examples in the book.

I'd like to thank my colleague [Tomer Steinfeld](https://twitter.com/corevous). We both work as full-time maintainers of Selenium IDE, and he's been a great teacher, sharing his expertise in the language.


Cheers,
