# Acknowledgements

It all started with a notion - write things down. That way when I was asked a question, rather than explain the answer poorly, I could just give someone a coherent, detailed explanation of how I solved a certain problem that they're facing right now with Selenium.

It started as a couple of blog posts, quickly turned into a weekly tip newsletter, and not-too-long after that it became a book. This book. The Ruby edition is where it all started. Since then it's evolved into five editions -- one for each of the officially supported programming languages in the Selenium project.

As the adage goes, I stand on the shoulders of giants. Thanks to everyone who's helped me along the way, and to the contributors of the Selenium project.

And thanks for reading! I hope you find it useful in your daily work.


Cheers,  
Dave H
