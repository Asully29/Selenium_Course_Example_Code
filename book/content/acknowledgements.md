They provided tremendous feedback that helped influence my thinking and ultimately transformed the book into something far greater than what it was before.

Katy, I somehow convinced you that doing one-on-one sessions with me over Google Hangout an hour a week would be a great way to learn more about Selenium. Over the course of that time an outline for the book emerged, and with your feedback and insights I was able to shape it into something useful and compelling. Without your help, I'm not sure how far along the book would be or if it would be as useful.

Brian, Ken, Jonathan, and Mary Ann -- your feedback was thorough and challenging. You asked tough questions and provided great suggestions for improvements. A good deal of the book has been rewritten based on your feedback. Examples have been refined. Concepts have been made more concise. And generally, there is a better build-up and flow throughout the book.

Donald, Dmytro, Ilkka, Jimi, Jason, Kent, Matt, Matthew, and Sergey -- your feedback has helped refine the book into something much more clear and concise. I'm ecstatic that you got so much out of the book and provided so much in return.

THANK YOU!
