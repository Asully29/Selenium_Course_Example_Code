# Acknowledgements

I'd like to take a moment to thank the following people (sorted alphabetically):

+ Katy Burns
+ Brian Goad
+ Jonathan Lipps
+ Mary Ann May-Pumphrey
+ Ken Pier

They provided tremendous feedback that helped influence my thinking and ultimately transformed the book into something far greater than what it was before.

Katy, I somehow convinced you that doing one-on-one sessions with me over Google Hangout an hour a week would be a great way to learn more about Selenium. Over the course of that time an outline for the book emerged, and with your feedback and insights I was able to shape it into something useful and compelling. Without your help, I'm not sure how far along the book would be or if it would be as useful.

Brian, Ken, Jonathan, and Mary Ann -- your feedback was thorough and challenging. You asked tough questions and provided great suggestions for improvements. A good deal of the book has been rewritten based on your feedback. Examples have been refined. Concepts have been made more concise. And generally, there is a better build-up and flow throughout the book.

THANK YOU!
