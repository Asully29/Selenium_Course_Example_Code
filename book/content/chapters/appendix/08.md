# File Upload

Normally when interacting with forms to upload a file you're prompted with a dialog box that is just out of reach for Selenium.

In these cases, people tend to turn to a tool to drive the GUI, such as Auto-IT. While this helps solve short-term pain, it sets you up for long term hurt later by chaining you to a specific platform -- limiting your ability to effectively test different browser/OS combinations.

A work-around for this problem is to side-step the dialog box experience entirely, and rather, inject the path of the file you want to upload into the form element, and then submit the form.

Let's break down this approach with some example Ruby code using Selenium WebDriver Remote and an example file upload form.

## An Example

You can see the application we are running against [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload).

For our test script, we'll first need to include our requisite libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, and `rspec-expectations` for our assertion) and wire-up some simple `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` actions.

```ruby
require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'rspec-expectations'
include RSpec::Matchers

def setup
  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
end

def teardown
  @driver.quit
end

def run
  setup
  yield
  teardown
end
```

Now we're ready to write our file upload test.

```ruby
run do
  file = 'some-file.txt'

  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload'
  @driver.find_element(id: 'file-upload').send_keys File.join(Dir.pwd, file)
  @driver.find_element(id: 'file-submit').click

  uploaded_file = @driver.find_element(id: 'uploaded-files').text
  uploaded_file.should eql file
end
```

## Expected Behavior

+ Load the page
+ Find the form element that stores the path of the file we want to upload
+ Inject the path of the file we want to upload
+ Find the form submit button and click it
+ Grab the text from the uploaded file list that gets rendered
+ Assert that the uploaded file is what we expect
