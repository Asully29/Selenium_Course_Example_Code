# Finding Information On Your Own

There is information all around us when it comes to Selenium. But it can be challenging to sift through, or know where to look.

Here is a list breaking down a majority of the Selenium resources available, and what they're useful for.

## Documentation & Tips

+ [Selenium HQ](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/)

This is the official Selenium project documentation site. It's a bit dated, but there is loads of helpful information here. You just have to get the hang of how to navigate the site to find what you need.

+ [The Selenium Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/w/list)

This is where all the good stuff is -- mainly, documentation about the various language bindings and browser drivers. If you're not already familiar with it, take a look.

+ [Elemental Selenium Archives](http://elementalselenium.com/tips)

Every tip I've written is freely available on the tips archive page. There are over 35 different Selenium problems and solutions covered.

## Blogs

+ [The official Selenium blog](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/)

This is where news of the Selenium project gets announced, and there's also the occasional round-up of what's going on in the tech space (as it relates to testing). Definitely worth a look.

+ [A list of "all" Selenium WebDriver blogs](http://it-kosmopolit.de/Selenium/blog/selenium-blogs/selenium_blogs.php)

At some point, someone rounded up a large list of blogs from Selenium practitioners and committers. It's a pretty good list.

## Other Books

+ [Selenium 2 Testing Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Selenium-Testing-Tools-Beginners-Guide/dp/1849518300)

This book is by [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester) and it is a tremendous and thorough resource. It outlines how to use Selenium, top-to-bottom. It's definitely worth having on your shelf.

+ [Selenium Testing Tools Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Selenium-Testing-Cookbook-Gundecha-Unmesh/dp/1849515743/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z)

This is another good book outlining loads of great ways to leverage Selenium. While I haven't had a chance to finish reading it, it's clear that Gundecha has a very pragmatic approach that will yield great results.

## Meetups

+ [The Selenium Hangout](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/the-worlds-best-selenium-meetup/)

This is an entirely online meetup that is run by me and [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester) where we talk about the latest in the Selenium community (e.g., the upcoming conference, the status of Selenium 3, etc.) and answer questions from the community. Videos are recorded and made available (along with notes) on [the official Selenium blog](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/).

+ [All Selenium Meetups listed on Meetup.com](http://selenium.meetup.com/)

A listing of all in-person Selenium Meetups are available on Meetup.com. If you're near a major city, odds are there's one waiting for you.

+ [How to start your own Selenium Meetup](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/10/so-you-want-to-start-a-selenium-meetup-group-now-what/)

If there's not a Selenium Meetup near you, start one! Sauce Labs has a great write up on how to do it.

## Conferences

+ [Selenium Conf](http://www.seleniumconf.org/)

This is a tremendous annual conference where practitioners and committers gather and share knowledge. All of the talks are top notch, as is the hallway track. I highly recommend it.

+ [Selenium Camp](http://seleniumcamp.com/)

This is an annual Selenium conference in Europe. I haven't been yet, but it sounds like a good event.

+ [List of other testing conferences](http://watirmelon.com/2013/12/11/software-testing-conferences-2014/)

[Alister Scott](https://twitter.com/alisterscott) has a good write-up of the testing conferences coming up this year.

## Videos

+ [Selenium Conference Talks](http://www.youtube.com/user/seleniumconf/videos)

All of the talks from The Selenium Conference are recorded and made freely available online. This is a tremendous resource.

+ [Selenium Meetup Talks](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=selenium%20meetup&sm=3)

Some of the Selenium Meetups make it a point to record their talks and publish them afterwards. Here are some of them. They are a great way to see what other people are doing and pick up some new tips.

+ [Selenium Hangout](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjmE7QwH0u6dXyfzlZ10f2Yz6d3mE9QEi)

All of the Selenium Hangout Meetups are recorded and made available. A lot of great stuff is discussed in them.

## Mailing Lists

+ [Selenium Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/selenium-users)
+ [Selenium LinkedIn Users Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Selenium-Test-Automation-User-Group-961927)

The signal to noise ratio in these groups can be challenging at times. But you can occasionally find some answers to your questions.

+ [Agile Testing Yahoo Group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/agile-testing/)

This list is less about Selenium and more about "testing" (in the [checking versus testing](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856) sense). It's a great place to ask for sage advice, and to hang out and listen. You will learn some valuable insights here.

## Forums

+ [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)
+ [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Selenium-testing-framework)

These are the usual forums where you can go looking for answers to questions you're facing (in addition to the mailing lists above).

## Issues

+ [Selenium Issue Tracker](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list)

If you're running into a specific and repeatable issue that just doesn't make sense, you may have found a bug in Selenium. You'll want to check the Selenium Issue Tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, then create a new issue. But be sure to read [this post](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html) before you do (so you can be sure that you have provided enough information).

## Chatting With the Selenium Community on IRC

The Selenium IRC Chat Channel is arguably the best way to connect with the Selenium community and get questions answered. This is where committers and practitioners hang out day-in and day-out. Let's step through what it is and how to access it.

### Brief Intro To IRC

IRC (short for Internet Relay Chat) is a protocol that freely enables live chatting (both in groups and person to person) and file sharing. It's been around for a while (circa 1988) and is the preferred mode of communication among certain tech circles.

Within the realm of IRC there are numerous servers you can connect to. Each one containing people and bots logged in and joined to one or more chat rooms talking, sharing files, etc.

One of the beautiful things about IRC is that there is no sign-up required to join the party. You just need to download a client that handles the IRC protocol (there's at least one available for every platform), point it at a server, and pick a unique nickname for yourself on that server.

Once you're on you can join a chat room and start jib-jabbing.

### How To Get Connected

#### Step 1: Get An IRC Chat Client

First thing's first, get a chat client that supports IRC.

You may already have one and not even know. For example, [Adium](https://adium.im/) (for OSX) supports a staggering number of chat protocols. If you already have it (or something like it) then use that to connect. If you don't, then you'll need to grab one (or one that is built specifically for IRC).

Here are some worthwhile IRC chat clients (broken out by platform -- and are free unless otherwise noted).

__OSX__

+ [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/)
+ [Textual](http://www.codeux.com/textual/) ($4.99 to buy)

__Windows__

+ [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/?/) (free for 30 days, $20 for a single-user license)

__Linux__

+ [Irssi](http://www.irssi.org/)

__Web-only__

+ [Webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/)
+ [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/) (free with paid tier as well, Android and iOS apps available as well)

#### Step 2: Connect To The Proper Server

The Selenium chat channel lives on the Freenode server. To connect to it directly you would use `irc.freenode.net`.

Before connecting you should be able to set a nickname and perhaps even specify which channel you would like to connect to after connecting (e.g., `#selenium`). If you don't see these bits, don't sweat it. Connect and proceed to the next step.

Note: If you're using Webchat, it will automatically connect you to Freenode.

#### Step 3: Join The Chat Channel

In IRC parlance channels are prepended with a `#` and are lower-case. So the Selenium channel is `#selenium`.

If you were able to configure your chat client to join the channel for you, then proceed to the next step. Otherwise, you'll need to issue a command in the status window. There are a series of commands you can issue in IRC. They are all prepended with a `/`. To join a chat channel type `/join #selenium` and press `Enter`.

This should open a new window in the app and in it should be the Selenium chat channel. Woohoo!

#### Step 4: Talk And Hangout

Feel free to say hello and introduce yourself. But more importantly, ask your question. And if it looks like no one is chatting, ask it anyway. Someone will see it and eventually respond. They always do.

In order to get your answer, you'll probably want to hang around for a bit. But the benefit of being a fly on the wall is that you quickly gain insight into other problems people face, possible solutions, and the current status of the Selenium project and its various pieces.
