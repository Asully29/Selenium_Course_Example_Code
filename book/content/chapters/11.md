# Prepping For Use

Now that we have tests, page objects, and a base page object, let's package things into a more useful structure.

## Folder Organization

It's about time we create some folders for our tests (specs) and page objects. To err on the side of simplicity, let's call the folders 'spec' (for our tests) and 'pages' (for our page objects). We are using `spec` (singular) since it's a default folder that RSpec will know to look for.

Here's everything we should have after creating folders and moving files around:

```sh
.
|-- Gemfile
|-- pages
|   |-- base_page.rb
|   |-- dynamic_loading.rb
|   `-- login.rb
`-- spec
    |-- dynamic_loading_spec.rb
    |-- login_spec.rb
```

## Updating Require Statements

As a result of doing this, we will need to update the require statements in our tests.

```ruby
# filename: spec/login_spec.rb

require_relative '../pages/login'

describe 'Login' do
...
```

```ruby
# filename: spec/dynamic_loading_spec.rb

require_relative '../pages/dynamic_loading'

describe 'Dynamic Loading' do
...
```

Notice the use of double-dots (`..`) in the page object require statement. This is how we tell Ruby to traverse up a directory. So `../pages/dynamic_loading` is traversing up from the spec directory, into the page objects folder, and then accessing `dynamic_loading`.

## Base URL

Up until now we've been hard-coding the URL we want to use for our application. But it's likely that the application could have numerous URL end-points. In the case of [the-internet](https://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet) there is the production URL (e.g., `http://the-internet.herokuapp.com`) and then there's running the app locally (e.g., `http://localhost:4567`).

In order to service both of these URLs with our tests we'll want to make it so we can specify a base URL at runtime and update our page objects to use it. And we want to set a sensible default for the base URL so if we specify nothing, a valid URL will be provided to our tests. So let's create a central file to store configuration values like this and make sure it can receive values at runtime. Let's create a `config.rb` file in the parent directory and place it there.

```ruby
# filename: config.rb

ENV['base_url'] ||= 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'
```

By using a conditional when setting the environment variable (`||=`) gets us our sensible default. We are making it so we can override this value when launching our test suite. It essentially means if the environment variable already exists and contains a value, use it. Otherwise, set it to 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'. This will come in handy later, and is something we'll use frequently.

With base URL in a central place we can now go and update our page objects to use it.

```ruby
# filename: pages/base_page.rb
require 'selenium-webdriver'

class BasePage

  def initialize(driver)
    @driver = driver
  end

  def visit(url_path)
    @driver.get ENV['base_url'] + url_path
  end
# ...
```

In our base page object we put the base URL environment variable to use in `visit`. By doing this we update the argument for the method from expecting an entire `url` to just the `url_path`. Now to update the use of `visit` in our page objects.

```ruby
# filename: pages/dynamic_loading.rb
require_relative 'base_page'

class DynamicLoading < BasePage

  START_BUTTON  = { css: '#start button' }
  FINISH_TEXT   = { id: 'finish' }

  def example(example_number)
    visit "/dynamic_loading/#{example_number}"
  end
# ...
```

```ruby
# filename: pages/login.rb
require_relative 'base_page'

class Login < BasePage

  LOGIN_FORM      = { id: 'login' }
  USERNAME_INPUT  = { id: 'username' }
  PASSWORD_INPUT  = { id: 'password' }
  SUBMIT_BUTTON   = { css: 'button'  }
  SUCCESS_MESSAGE = { css: '.flash.success' }
  FAILURE_MESSAGE = { css: '.flash.error' }

  def initialize(driver)
    super
    visit '/login'
    raise 'Login page not ready' unless
      is_displayed?(LOGIN_FORM)
  end
# ...
```

Now our page objects are free from hard-coded URLs, making our tests more flexible.

## Global Setup And Teardown

Now we're ready to pull the test setup and teardown actions out of our tests and into a central place. In RSpec this is straight-forward through the use of a `spec_helper` file. This can live alongside the other test files in the `spec` directory.

```ruby
# filename: spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'selenium-webdriver'

RSpec.configure do |config|

  config.before(:each) do
    @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
  end

  config.after(:each) do
    @driver.quit
  end

end
```

We require the Selenium library here since we're working directly with it. By having it here we can remove it from our base page object. We can also remove our Selenium commands from the `before(:each)` and `after(:each)` in our tests -- replacing them with a simple require statement at the top of the file (`require_relative 'spec_helper'`). We will also be able to remove the `after(:each)` method from our tests, leaving just the `before(:each)` for use with our page objects.

Here's what our tests look like with these changes:

```ruby
# filename: spec/login_spec.rb
require_relative 'spec_helper'
require_relative '../pages/login'

describe 'Login' do

  before(:each) do
    @login = Login.new(@driver)
  end

  it 'succeeded' do
    @login.with('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!')
    expect(@login.success_message_present?).to eql true
  end

  it 'failed' do
    @login.with('asdf', 'asdf')
    expect(@login.failure_message_present?).to eql true
  end

end
```

```ruby
# filename: spec/dynamic_loading_spec.rb
require_relative 'spec_helper'
require_relative '../pages/dynamic_loading'

describe 'Dynamic Loading' do

  before(:each) do
    @dynamic_loading = DynamicLoading.new(@driver)
  end

  it 'Example 1: Hidden Element' do
    @dynamic_loading.example 1
    @dynamic_loading.start
    expect(@dynamic_loading.finish_text_present?).to eql true
  end

  it 'Example 2: Rendered after the fact' do
    @dynamic_loading.example 2
    @dynamic_loading.start
    expect(@dynamic_loading.finish_text_present?).to eql true
  end

end
```

## Running Everything

Now that things are cleaned up, let's run everything. To do that we'll want to make sure to include our new config file. We can do that by specifying it at run time with `rspec --require ./config.rb`, or, `rspec -r ./config.rb` (for short). Note the `./` before `config.rb`. This tells RSpec that the config file is in the current directory.

To specify a different base URL, prepend the command with it (e.g., `base_url=http://localhost:4567 rspec -r ./config.rb` if you had a local instance of [the-internet](https://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet) running).

Give it a shot. All of the tests should run and pass.
