# Things You will See And How To Work With Them

The examples in this section aim to give you a glimpse at things you will see in the wild, and a reference for to deal with them.

They will not build upon previous examples like the earlier parts of this book. But instead, serve as standalone works that can be consumed individually -- and alphabetically.

Enjoy!
