# How To Write Maintainable Tests

One of the biggest challenges with Selenium tests is that they can be brittle and challenging to maintain over time. This is largely due to the fact that things in the app you're testing change, breaking your tests.

But the reality of a software project is that change is a constant. So we need to account for this reality somehow in our test code in order to be successful.

Enter Page Objects.

Rather than write your test code directly against your app, you can model the behavior of your application into simple objects and write your tests against them instead. That way when your app changes and your tests break, you only have to update your test code in one place to fix it.

With this approach we not only get the benefit of controlled chaos, we also get the benefit of reusable functionality across our tests.

## An Example

### Part 1: Create A Page Object And Update Test

Let's take our login example from the previous chapter and pull it out into a page object and update our test accordingly.

```ruby
# filename: login.rb

class Login

  USERNAME_INPUT  = { id: 'username' }
  PASSWORD_INPUT  = { id: 'password' }
  SUBMIT_BUTTON   = { css: 'button'  }
  SUCCESS_MESSAGE = { css: '.flash.success' }

  def initialize(driver)
    @driver = driver
    @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login'
  end

  def with(username, password)
    @driver.find_element(USERNAME_INPUT).send_keys(username)
    @driver.find_element(PASSWORD_INPUT).send_keys(password)
    @driver.find_element(SUBMIT_BUTTON).click
  end

  def success_message_present?
    @driver.find_element(SUCCESS_MESSAGE).displayed?
  end

end
```

We start by creating our own class, naming it accordingly (`Login`), and storing our locators in hashes within constants along the top.

We then use an `initialize` method. This is a built in method for classes in Ruby that enable you to automatically execute code upon instantiating the class (a.k.a. a constructor). With it we are taking an argument to receive the Selenium driver object and storing it in an instance variable. This will enable the class to drive the browser.

In our `with` method we are capturing the core behavior of the login page by accepting the username and password input values and putting them to use with the typing and clicking actions for the login form.

Since our behavior now lives in a page object, we want a clean way to make an assertion in our test. This is where `success_message_present?` comes in. Notice that it ends with a question mark. Methods that end like this are known as mutator methods. When they end with a question mark, they imply that they will return a boolean. So in it we want to ask a question of the page with Selenium so that we can return a boolean (e.g., `@driver.find_element(SUCCESS_MESSAGE).displayed?`). In our test we will put this boolean to work by making an assertion against it.

Now let's update our test to use this page object.

```ruby
# filename: login_spec.rb

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require_relative 'login'

describe 'Login' do

  before(:each) do
    @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
    @login = Login.new(@driver)
  end

  after(:each) do
    @driver.quit
  end

  it 'succeeded' do
    @login.with('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!')
    expect(@login.success_message_present?).to eql true
  end

end
```

At the top of the file we include the page object by using `require_relative`. This enables us to reference another file based on the current file's path.

Next we instantiate our login page object in `before(:each)`, passing in `@driver` as an argument, and storing it all in an instance variable (`@login`). We then wire up our test to use the actions available in `@login`.

We finish things up by making an assertion against our helper method (`expect(@login.success_message_present?`).to eql true`).

### Part 2: Write Another Test

This may feel like more work than what we had when we first started. But we're in a much sturdier position and able to write follow-on tests more easily. Let's add another test to demonstrate a failed login.

If we provide incorrect credentials, the following markup gets rendered on the page.

```html
<div id="flash-messages" class="large-12 columns">
  <div data-alert="" id="flash" class="flash error">
    Your username is invalid!
    <a href="#" class="close">x</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

This is similar to the markup from our successful flash message, so the mechanics will similar in our page object. First we'll add a new locator for the failure message in our list of constants at the top of our class (just below our success message locator).

```ruby
# filename: login.rb

class Login

  USERNAME_INPUT  = { id: 'username' }
  PASSWORD_INPUT  = { id: 'password' }
  SUBMIT_BUTTON   = { css: 'button'  }
  SUCCESS_MESSAGE = { css: '.flash.success' }
  FAILURE_MESSAGE = { css: '.flash.error' }
  #...
```

Further down the file (just after the existing mutator method) we'll add a new method to check to see if the failure message is displayed.

```ruby
# filename: login.rb
# ...
  def success_message_present?
    @driver.find_element(SUCCESS_MESSAGE).displayed?
  end

  def failure_message_present?
    @driver.find_element(FAILURE_MESSAGE).displayed?
  end

end
```

Lastly, we add a new test in our spec file just below our existing one, specifying invalid credentials to force a failure.

```ruby
# filename: login_spec.rb
# ...
  it 'succeeded' do
    @login.with('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!')
    expect(@login.success_message_present?).to eql true
  end

  it 'failed' do
    @login.with('asdf', 'asdf')
    expect(@login.failure_message_present?).to eql true
  end

end
```

Now if we run our spec file (`rspec login_spec.rb`) we will see two browser windows open (one after the other) testing both the successful and failure login conditions.
