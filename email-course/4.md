# Writing Resilient Test Code

Ideally, you should be able to write your tests once and run them across all supported browsers. While this is a rosy proposition, there is some work to make this a reliable success. And sometimes there may be a hack or two involved. But the lengths you must go really depends on the browsers you care about and the functionality you're dealing with.

By using high quality locators you will be well ahead of the pack, but there are still some issues to deal with. Most notably -- timing. This is especially true when working with dynamic, JavaScript heavy, pages (which is more the rule than the exception in a majority of applications you'll deal with).

But there is a simple approach that makes up the bedrock of reliable and resilient Selenium tests -- and that's how you wait and interact with elements. The best way to accomplish this is through the use of __explicit waits__.

## An Explicit Waits Primer

Explicit waits are applied to individual test actions. Each time you want to use one you specify an amount of time (in seconds) and the Selenium action action you want to accomplish.

Selenium will repeatedly try this action until either it can be accomplished, or the amount of time specified has been reached. If the latter occurs, a timeout exception will be thrown.

## An Example

Let's step through an example that demonstrates this against [a dynamic page on the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1). The functionality is pretty simple -- there is a button. When you click it a loading bar appears for 5 seconds, then disappears, and gets replaced with the text 'Hello World!'.

Let's start by looking at the markup on the page.

```html
<div class="example">
  <h3>Dynamically Loaded Page Elements</h3>
  <h4>Example 1: Element on page that is hidden</h4>

  <br>

  <div id="start">
    <button>Start</button>
  </div>

  <div id="finish" style="display:none">
    <h4>Hello World!</h4>
  </div>

</div>
```

At a glance it's simple enough to tell that there are unique `id` attributes that we can use to reference the start button and finish text.

Let's add a page object for Dynamic Loading.

```ruby
# filename: dynamic_loading.rb

class DynamicLoading

  START_BUTTON  = { css: '#start button' }
  FINISH_TEXT   = { id: 'finish' }

  def initialize(driver)
    @driver = driver
    @driver.get "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1"
  end

  def start
    @driver.find_element(START_BUTTON).click
  end

  def finish_text_present?
    wait_for { is_displayed? FINISH_TEXT }
  end

  def is_displayed?(locator)
    @driver.find_element(locator).displayed?
  end

  def wait_for(timeout = 15)
    Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout => timeout).until { yield }
  end

end
```

This approach should look familiar from the last lesson. The thing which is new is the `wait_for` method. In it we are using the built-in mechanism Selenium has for explicit waits.

## More On Explicit Waits

It's important to set a _reasonably sized_ timeout for the explicit wait. But you want to be careful not to make it too high. Otherwise you run into a lot of the same timing issues you get from implicit waits. But set it too low and your tests will be brittle, forcing you to run down trivial and transient issues.

Now that we have our page object we can wire this up in a new test file.

```ruby
# filename: dynamic_loading_spec.rb

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require_relative 'dynamic_loading'

describe 'Dynamic Loading' do

  before(:each) do
    @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
    @dynamic_loading = DynamicLoading.new(@driver)
  end

  after(:each) do
    @driver.quit
  end

  it 'Waited for Hidden Element' do
    @dynamic_loading.start
    @dynamic_loading.finish_text_present?.should be_true
  end

end
```

When we run this test file (`rspec dynamic_loading_page.rb` from the command-line) it should pass.

Now let's step through [one more dynamic page example](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/47-waiting) to see if our explicit wait approach holds up.

Our second example is laid out similarly to the last one. The main difference is that it will render the final result __after__ the progress bar completes. Here's the markup for it.

```html
<div class="example">
  <h3>Dynamically Loaded Page Elements</h3>
  <h4>Example 2: Element rendered after the fact</h4>

  <br>

  <div id="start">
    <button>Start</button>
  </div>

  <br>
</div>
```

In order to find the selector for the finish text element we need to inspect the page after the loading bar sequence finishes. Here's what it looks like.

```html
<div id="finish" style=""><h4>Hello World!</h4></div>
```

Before we add our test, we need to modify our page object to accommodate visiting the different example URLs.

```ruby
# filename: dynamic_loading.rb

class DynamicLoading

  START_BUTTON  = { css: '#start button' }
  FINISH_TEXT   = { id: 'finish' }

  def initialize(driver)
    @driver = driver
  end

  def visit_example(example_number)
    @driver.get "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/#{example_number}"
  end

  ...
```

Now that we have that covered, let's add a new test to reference the markup shown above (and update our existing test to use the new `.visit_example` method).

```ruby
# filename: dynamic_loading_spec.rb

require_relative 'dynamic_loading'

describe 'Dynamic Loading' do

  ...

  it 'Waited for Hidden Element' do
    @dynamic_loading.visit_example 1
    @dynamic_loading.start
    @dynamic_loading.finish_text_present?.should be_true
  end

  it 'Waited for Element To Render' do
    @dynamic_loading.visit_example 2
    @dynamic_loading.start
    @dynamic_loading.finish_text_present?.should be_true
  end

end
```

If we run these tests (`rspec dynamic_loading_spec.rb` from the command-line) then the same approach will work for both cases.

Explicit waits are one of the most important concepts in testing with Selenium. Use them often.
