# Packaging For Use

Now that we have some tests and page objects, we'll want to start thinking about how to structure our test code to be more flexible. That way it can scale to meet our needs.

## Global Setup & Teardown

We'll start by pulling the Selenium setup and teardown out of our tests and into a central location.

To do that, we'll want to create a base test. So let's create a new file called `Base.java` in the `tests` package.

```text
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   └── test
│       └── java
│           ├── pageobjects
│           │   ├── DynamicLoading.java
│           │   └── Login.java
│           └── tests
│               ├── Base.java
│               ├── TestDynamicLoading.java
│               └── TestLogin.java
```

And here are the contents of the file.

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java

package tests;

import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.rules.ExternalResource;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;

public class Base {

    protected WebDriver driver;

    @Rule
    public ExternalResource resource = new ExternalResource() {

        @Override
        protected void before() throws Throwable {
            driver = new FirefoxDriver();
        }

        @Override
        protected void after() {
            driver.quit();
        }

    };

}
```

After importing a few necessary classes we specify the `Base` class and wire up some methods that will take care of setting up and tearing down Selenium before and after every test.

It's worth noting that we could have used methods with `@Before` and `@After` annotations just like before. But if we did that we'd be giving up the ability to use these annotations in our tests (which we'll want to use for page object instantiation).

To preserve this functionality we're using JUnit's `ExternalResource` Rule. This rule has `before` and `after` methods that execute prior to methods annotated with `@Before` and `@After`. For more info on JUnit's Rules, read [this](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Rules). Now let's update our tests to establish inheritance with this base test class, remove the Selenium setup/teardown actions, and remove the unnecessary import statements. When we're done our test files should look like this:

```java
// filename: tests/TestLogin.java
package tests;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.Before;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import pageobjects.Login;

public class TestLogin extends Base {

    private Login login;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        login = new Login(driver);
    }

    @Test
    public void succeeded() {
        login.with("tomsmith", "SuperSecretPassword!");
        assertTrue("success message not present",
                login.successMessagePresent());
    }

    @Test
    public void failed() {
        login.with("tomsmith", "bad password");
        assertTrue("failure message wasn't present after providing bogus credentials",
                login.failureMessagePresent());
        assertFalse("success message was present after providing bogus credentials",
                login.successMessagePresent());
    }

}
```

```java
// filename: tests/TestDynamicLoading.java

package tests;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.Before;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import pageobjects.DynamicLoading;

public class TestDynamicLoading extends Base {

    private DynamicLoading dynamicLoading;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        dynamicLoading = new DynamicLoading(driver);
    }

    @Test
    public void hiddenElementLoads() {
        dynamicLoading.loadExample("1");
        assertTrue("finish text didn't display after loading",
                dynamicLoading.finishTextPresent());
    }

    @Test
    public void elementAppears() {
        dynamicLoading.loadExample("2");
        assertTrue("finish text didn't render after loading",
                dynamicLoading.finishTextPresent());
    }

}
```

## Running Tests On Any Browser

If you've ever needed to test features in an older browser like Internet Explorer 8 then odds are you ran a virtual machine (VM) on your computer with a "legit" version of Windows XP.

Handy, but what happens when you need to check things on multiple versions of IE? Now you're looking at multiple VMs. And what about when you need to scale and cover other browser and Operating System (OS) combinations? Now you're looking at provisioning, running, and maintaining your own set of machines and standing up something like Selenium Grid to coordinate tests across them.

Rather than take on the overhead of a test infrastructure you can easily outsource this to a third-party cloud provider like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

## An Example

__NOTE: You'll need an account to use Sauce Labs. Their [free trial](https://saucelabs.com/signup/trial) offers enough to get you started. And if you're signing up because you want to test an open source project, then be sure to check out their [Open Sauce account](https://saucelabs.com/opensauce).__

With Sauce Labs we need to provide specifics about what we want in our test environment, our credentials, and configure Selenium a little bit differently than we have been. Let's start by creating a file for these various configuration values.

Let's create a file called Config.java in the tests package.

```text
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   └── test
│       └── java
│           ├── pageobjects
│           │   ├── DynamicLoading.java
│           │   └── Login.java
│           └── tests
│               ├── Base.java
│               ├── Config.java
│               ├── TestDynamicLoading.java
│               └── TestLogin.java
```

In it we'll create an interface and specify field variables for the different configuration values we need.

```java
// filename: tests/Config.java

package tests;

public interface Config {
    final String baseUrl        = System.getProperty("baseUrl", "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");
    final String browser        = System.getProperty("browser", "firefox");
    final String host           = System.getProperty("host", "localhost");
    final String browserVersion = System.getProperty("browserVersion", "33");
    final String platform       = System.getProperty("platform", "Windows XP");
    final String sauceUser      = "your-sauce-username";
    final String sauceKey       = "your-sauce-access-key";
}
```

`host` enables us to specify whether our tests run locally or on Sauce Labs. If we don't specify a value at runtime, then the tests will execute locally.

With `browser`, `browserVeresion`, and `platform` we can specify which browser and operating system combination we want our tests to run on. You can see a full list of Sauce's available platform options [here](https://saucelabs.com/platforms/). They also have a handy configuration generator (which will tell you what values to plug into your test) [here](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/platforms-configurator/). We've made so if no values are provided at run time, they will default to `firefox` version `33` running on `Windows XP`.
`sauceUser` is your Sauce username, and `sauceKey` is your Sauce Access Key (which can be found on [your account dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/account)). An alternative to hard-coding your credentials is to store them in environment variables and retrieve them.

```java
final String sauceUser      = System.getenv("SAUCE_USERNAME");
final String sauceKey       = System.getenv("SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY");
```

Do whichever you're more comfortable and familiar with.

Now we can update our base test class to work with Selenium Remote (which is how we'll be able to connect to Sauce Labs).

```java
// filename: tests/Base.java
// ...
        @Override
        protected void before() throws Throwable {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browser);
                capabilities.setCapability("version", browserVersion);
                capabilities.setCapability("platform", platform);
                String sauceUrl = String.format("http://%s:%s@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub",
                        sauceUser, sauceKey);
                driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(sauceUrl), capabilities);
            } else if (host.equals("localhost")) {
                if (browser.equals("firefox")) {
                    driver = new FirefoxDriver();
                } else if (browser.equals("chrome")) {
                    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver",
                            System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/vendor/chromedriver");
                    driver = new ChromeDriver();
                }
            }
        }
// ...
```

In our `before` method we've added a new conditional flow (e.g., `if`/`else if`) to check the `host` variable.

We start by checking to see if it's set to `"saucelabs"`. If it is we create a `DesiredCapabilities` object, populate it (with `browser`, `browserVersion`, and `platform` values), and connect to Sauce Labs using Selenium Remote (passing in the `DesiredCapabilities` object). This will return a Selenium WebDriver object that we can use just like when running our tests locally.

If the `host` variable is set to `"localhost"` then our tests will run locally just like before.

If we save everything and run our tests in Sauce Labs (e.g., `mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs`) then on the account dashboard we'll see our tests running in Firefox 33 on Windows XP.

And if we wanted to run our tests on different browser and operating system combinations, here are what some of the commands would look like:

```
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser="internet explorer" -DbrowserVersion=8
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser="internet explorer" -DbrowserVersion=10 -Dplatform="Windows 8.1"
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser=firefox -DbrowserVersion=26 -Dplatform="Windows 7"
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser=safari -DbrowserVersion=8 -Dplatform="OS X 10.10"
mvn clean test -Dhost=saucelabs -Dbrowser=chrome -DbrowserVersion=40 -Dplatform="OS X 10.8"
```

Notice the properties with quotations (e.g., `"internet explorer"` and `"OS X 10.10"`). When dealing with more than one word in a runtime property we need to make sure to surround them in double-quotes (or else our test code won't compile).
