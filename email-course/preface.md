# Preface

Thanks for checking out my bootcamp on Getting Started with Selenium!

I'm Dave Haeffner, the writer of [Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com/) and [The Selenium Guidebook](https://seleniumguidebook.com/). My goal for this book is to provide you with enough information to get started on the right foot with automated web testing, while also keeping things as actionable and succinct as possible.

Enjoy!


Cheers,
