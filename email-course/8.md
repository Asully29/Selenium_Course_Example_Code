# Finding Information On Your Own

There is information all around us when it comes to Selenium. But it it can be challenging to sift through it, or know where to look.

Here is a list breaking down a majority of the Selenium resources available, and what they're useful for.

## Documentation & Tips

+ [Selenium HQ](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/)

This is the official Selenium project documentation site. It's a bit dated, but there is loads of helpful information here. You just have to get the hang of how the navigate site to find what you need.

+ [The Selenium Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/w/list)

This is where all the good stuff is -- mainly, documentation about the various language bindings and browser drivers. If you're not already familiar with it, take a look.

+ [Elemental Selenium Archives](http://elementalselenium.com/tips)

Every tip I've written in my weekly Selenium newsletter is freely available on the archive page. There are dozens of different Selenium problems and solutions covered. If you like what you see, sign up for the newsletter (on [the homepage](http://elementalselenium.com/) or at the bottom of a tip) to get new ones sent directly to your inbox every Tuesday.

## Blogs

+ [The official Selenium blog](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/)

This is where news of the Selenium project gets announced, and there's also the occasional round-up of what's going on in the tech space (as it relates to testing). Definitely worth a look.

+ [A list of "all" Selenium WebDriver blogs](http://it-kosmopolit.de/Selenium/blog/selenium-blogs/selenium_blogs.php)

At some point, someone rounded up a large list of blogs from Selenium practitioners and committers. It's a pretty good list.

## Other Books

+ [The Selenium Guidebook](http://davehaeffner.com/selenium-guidebook/)

This is the book I wish existed when I first started out. It teaches you how to program, write tests, build a framework, and scale it. I think it's pretty good, but then again, I wrote it.

+ [Selenium 2 Testing Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Selenium-Testing-Tools-Beginners-Guide/dp/1849518300)

This book is by [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester) and it is a tremendous and thorough resource. It outlines how to use Selenium, top-to-bottom. It's definitely worth having on your shelf.

+ [Selenium Testing Tools Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Selenium-Testing-Cookbook-Gundecha-Unmesh/dp/1849515743/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z)

This is another good book outlining loads of great ways to leverage Selenium. While I haven't had a chance to finish reading it, it's clear that Gundecha has a very pragmatic approach that will yield great results.

## Meetups

+ [The Selenium Hangout](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/the-worlds-best-selenium-meetup/)

This is an entirely online meetup that is run by me and [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester) where we talk about the latest in the Selenium community (e.g., the upcoming conference, the status of Selenium 3, etc.) and answer questions from the community. Videos are recorded and made available (along with notes) on [the official Selenium blog](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/).

+ [All Selenium Meetups listed on Meetup.com](http://selenium.meetup.com/)

A listing of all in-person Selenium Meetups are available on Meetup.com. If you're near a major city, odds are there's one waiting for you.

+ [How to start your own Selenium Meetup](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/10/so-you-want-to-start-a-selenium-meetup-group-now-what/)

If there's not a Selenium Meetup near you, start one! Sauce Labs has a great write up on how to do it.

## Conferences

+ [Selenium Conf](http://www.seleniumconf.org/)

This is a tremendous annual conference where practitioners and committers gather and share knowledge. All of the talks are top notch, as is the hallway track. I highly recommend it.

+ [Selenium Camp](http://seleniumcamp.com/)

This is an annual Selenium conference in Europe. I haven't been yet, but it sounds like a good event.

+ [List of other testing conferences](http://watirmelon.com/2013/12/11/software-testing-conferences-2014/)

[Alister Scott](https://twitter.com/alisterscott) has a good write-up of the testing conferences coming up this year.

## Videos

+ [Selenium Conference Talks](http://www.youtube.com/user/seleniumconf/videos)

All of the talks from The Selenium Conference are recorded and made freely available online. This is a tremendous resource.

+ [Selenium Meetup Talks](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=selenium%20meetup&sm=3)

Some of the Selenium Meetups make it a point to record their talks and publish them afterwards. Here are some of them. They are a great way to see what other people are doing and pick up some new tips.

+ [Selenium Hangout](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjmE7QwH0u6dXyfzlZ10f2Yz6d3mE9QEi)

All of the Selenium Hangout Meetups are recorded and made available. A lot of great stuff is discussed in them.

## Mailing Lists

+ [Selenium Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/selenium-users)
+ [Selenium LinkedIn Users Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Selenium-Test-Automation-User-Group-961927)

The signal to noise ratio in these groups can be challenging at times. But you can occasionally find some answers to your questions.

+ [Agile Testing Yahoo Group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/agile-testing/)

This list is less about Selenium and more about "testing" (in the [checking versus testing](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856) sense). It's a great place to ask for sage advice, and to hang out and listen. You will learn some valuable insights here.

## Forums

+ [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)
+ [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Selenium-testing-framework)

These are the usual forums where you can go looking for answers to questions you're facing (in addition to the mailing lists above).

## Issues

+ [Selenium Issue Tracker](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list)

If you're running into a specific and repeatable issue that just doesn't make sense, you may have found a bug in Selenium. You'll want to check the Selenium Issue Tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, then create a new issue. But be sure to read [this post](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html) before you do (so you can be sure that you have provided enough information).

## Chatting With the Selenium Community on IRC

+ [How to access the Selenium IRC Chat Channel](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/20-irc-chat)

The Selenium IRC Chat Channel is arguably the best way to connect with the Selenium community and get questions answered. This is where committers and practitioners hang out day-in and day-out. The link above will help you better understand exactly what it is and how to access it.

## Outro

The journey for doing Selenium successfully can be long and arduous. But by adhering to the principals in these write-ups, you will avoid a good deal of the pitfalls around you. You're also in a better position now -- armed with the information necessary to continue your Selenium journey on your own.
