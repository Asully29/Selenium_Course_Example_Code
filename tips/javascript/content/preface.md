# Preface

This book is a compendium of tips from my weekly Selenium tip newsletter ([Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com/)). It's aim is to give you a glimpse into the things you'll see in the wild, and a reference for how to deal with them.

The tips differ from The Selenium Guidebook in that they do not build upon previous examples. Instead, they serve as standalone works that can be consumed individually. So feel free to read them in order, or jump around.

A few years ago I open-sourced the code examples in Elemental Selenium, and started receiving contributions from the community. For JavaScript, [Manoj Kumar](https://twitter.com/manoj9788) stepped up and submitted some examples using ES6 and `async`/`await`. A huge thanks! It's been a long time coming for me to offer these tips in JavaScript, and I'm excited to finally do so. I hope they serve you well.


Enjoy!
