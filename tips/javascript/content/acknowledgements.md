When I started my weekly tip newsletter for Selenium it was just in Ruby. I eventually branched out to Java, and later on to C# and Python. I saved JavaScript for last, and unfortunately, never got around to making tips available for the language -- until now.

Somewhere along the way I [open-sourced my tip code examples](https://github.com/tourdedave/elemental-selenium-tips) to and started receiving contributions from the community. 

For JavaScript, [Manoj Kumar](https://twitter.com/manoj9788) stepped up and submitted the first examples using ES6 and `async`/`await`. It was a welcome contribution that served as a helpful nudge to get me started on this path. Thank you! 

It's been a long time coming for me to offer these tips in JavaScript, and I'm excited to finally do so.
